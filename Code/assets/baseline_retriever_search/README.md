This folder documents the process of collecting and filtering papers for the baseline retriever search in the context of a thesis. The goal is to identify relevant papers that can be used as baselines for comparison with the HubLink system, which integrates LLMs and KGs for question answering tasks.

This folder contains two files:

1. `baseline_retriever_search.py`: This file contains all papers which we have considered for the baseline retriever search. We explain whether the paper is relevant or not and why.
2. `baseline_retriever_search.md`: This file documents the process of collecting the papers and the criteria we used to select them.
