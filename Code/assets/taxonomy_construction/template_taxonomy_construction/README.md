The following folders contain the artifacts for the taxonomy construction process

- [Planning](./planning): This folder contains the artifacts for the planning of the taxonomy.
- [Literature Survey](./literature_survey/): In this folder, the artifacts for the literature survey are stored. Here, it is documented which papers were considered for the taxonomy construction process.
- [Extraction](./extraction/): This folder contains the artifacts for the extraction of the question types from the literature. It contains the extracted types and the analysis of the extraction process.
- [Clustering](./clustering): This folder contains the artifacts for the clustering of the extracted types. It contains the clustering process and the analysis of the clusters.
- [Relevance Assessment](./relevance_assessment): This folder contains the artifacts for the relevance assessment of the extracted types. It documents which of the clusters were considered relevant for the taxonomy and which were not.
- [Construction and Refinement](./construction_and_refinement/): This folder documents the construction and refinement of the taxonomy construction process. It contains the increments of the taxonomy construction process with their descriptions and the resulting taxonomies.
- [Validation](./validation/): This folder contains the artifacts for the validation of the taxonomy. It provided several metrics for assessing the quality of the taxonomy.
- [Application](./application/): This folder contains the artifacts for the application of the taxonomy on questions. It applies the final taxonomy iteration on selected questions and also applies taxonomies from the literature to the same questions. It also provides an analysis of the results.
