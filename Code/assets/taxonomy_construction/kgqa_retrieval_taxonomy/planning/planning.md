# Planning

According to the construction approach, the planning phase should include five different steps that help to guide the objective and intended use of the proposed taxonomy. In the following, we will describe each of the individual steps.

**S1:** The main objective of the taxonomy is to *classify the characteristics of questions posed to KGQA retrieval systems in the literature search domain, allowing the creation of diverse sets of questions that test a broad range of retrieval capabilities.*

**S2:** The domain to which the taxonomy is intended to be applied is *literature search on RKGs*.

**S3:** The classification structure type selected for the taxonomy is a *facet-based* structure. It defines multiple distinct categories, where each has its own set of classes. The advantage of such structure is that it can easily be adapted to changes in the classification requirements.

**S4:** The classification procedure type is *qualitative* since it is based on nominal scales.

**S5:** The taxonomy consists of question classification types drawn from the literature. For the literature survey, we have defined the following categories as relevant: The first category is *Research Questions*, literature in this category to provide information on questions relevant to the research process of a practitioner. The second category is *Question Classifier*, as this category includes literature that provides a model or approach to classifying questions according to a taxonomy. As these publications are also expected to provide information about the types that the classifier is classifying, this category is also expected to provide valuable insights. Finally, the *Knowledge Graph Question Answering Dataset* category includes literature proposing a QA dataset specifically for KGs. This is particularly useful for our use case as it has the potential to provide KG-specific information.
