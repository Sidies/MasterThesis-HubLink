Types of Questions{ /* 10 different query types */
 	Single fact, /* These questions can be answered using a single fact. For example, “What year was ‘SIRA: SNR-Aware Intra-Frame Rate Adaptation’ published?”*/
 	Multiple facts, /*These questions require connecting two or more facts to answer. For
example, “In SIGCSE, which paper written by Darina Dicheva with Dichev, Christo was
published?” */
 	Boolean, /*These questions answer where a given fact is true or false. We can also add
negation keywords to negate the questions. For example, “Does Szeider, Stefan have an
ORCID?” */
 	Negation, /*These questions require to negate the answer to the Boolean questions. For
example, “Did M. Hachani not publish in ICCP?” */
 	Double negation, /*These questions require to negate the Boolean question answers twice
which results. For example, “Wasn’t the paper ‘Multi-Task Feature Selection on Multiple
Networks via Maximum Flows’ not published in 2014?” */
 	Double intent, /*questions poses two user intentions, usually about the same subject. For
example, “In which venue was the paper ‘Interactive Knowledge Distillation for image
classification’ published and when? */
 	Union, /*questions cover a single intent but for multiple subjects at the same time. For
example, “List all the papers that Pitas, Konstantinos published in ICML and ISCAS.”
 	 */
 	Count, /* These questions pertain to the count of occurrence of facts. For example, “Count
the authors of ‘Optimal Symmetry Breaking for Graph Problems’ who have Carnegie
Mellon University as their primary affiliation.” */
 	Superlative-Comparative, /* Superlative questions ask about the maximum and minimum
for a subject and comparative questions compare values between two subjects. We group
both types under one group. For example, “Who has published the most papers among
the authors of ‘k-Pareto optimality for many-objective genetic optimization’?” */
 	Disambiguation /*questions requires identifying the correct subject in the question. For
example, “Which author with the name Li published the paper about Buck power converters?” */
