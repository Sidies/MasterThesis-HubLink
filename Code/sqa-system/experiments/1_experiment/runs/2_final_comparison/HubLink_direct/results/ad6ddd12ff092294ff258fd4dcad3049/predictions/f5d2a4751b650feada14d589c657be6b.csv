Although source [3] states that “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” is a personal experience paper, the overwhelming majority of texts indicate that no paper actually qualifies as a personal experience paper. 

Consequently, since there are no papers with the paper class personal experience paper, there is no list to rank in descending order by publication year.

One partial answer [1] indicates that the tool support is provided, noting that the tool support is available and that the flag “None” is set to False (implying its presence). In contrast, another partial answer [2] explains that while one description mentions that tool support is available, other sources clearly indicate that tool support is either explicitly set as False or noted as not used. Furthermore, [2] points out that there is some confusion about the paper’s title, as some contexts actually refer to a different paper.

Thus, based on the provided texts, there is contradictory information: some evidence supports that tool support is available, while other evidence contradicts that claim. Additionally, the discrepancy in the paper title adds to the uncertainty concerning the correct details for the paper ""Data-Driven Software Architecture for Analyzing Confidentiality.""

On one hand, some texts explicitly state that tool support is employed or indicated as available ([1], [2], [4]). On the other hand, multiple sources report that the tool support is not available or not used ([1], [2], [3], [4]). Notably, one source mentions that while tool support is marked as True, the details still indicate that it is not actually used ([1], [3]). In addition, one partial answer points out that for the paper titled ""An Empirical Study of Architectural Decay in Open-Source Software"" there is no explicit information regarding tool support, with the discussion relating instead to a different study ([5]). 

Thus, based on the majority of the evidence provided, it appears that tool support is not available for the referenced contribution, even though some sources ambiguously suggest its use.

• Argumentation  
• Motivating Example

Text [1] states that these two methods (Argumentation and Motivating Example) are mentioned in the evaluation texts, and text [14] confirms that with regard to this particular paper no additional evaluation method is explicitly reported in the provided information.

Nevertheless, across the different sources the validity discussion (associated with the contribution “Validity 2”) consistently examines the following five aspects of validity:

 • Confirmability  
 • Internal validity  
 • Construct validity  
 • Repeatability  
 • External validity

The status assigned to each of these aspects varies from one source to another. For example, one source reports that internal validity is false while construct and external validity are true ([1]), whereas another states that all aspects are false ([2], [9]). Yet another source indicates that internal and external validity are true while the other three aspects are false ([6]). Additional variations also appear among the remaining texts ([3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [10]). 

In summary, although the five threats to validity commonly discussed are confirmability, internal validity, construct validity, repeatability, and external validity, none of the provided texts directly address these threats in relation to “A Blockchain‐Based Micro Economy Platform for Distributed Infrastructure Initiatives” ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]).

One source ([1]) explains that the work presents a single overall threat to validity, which is then broken down into several aspects—namely, external validity, internal validity, construct validity, repeatability, and confirmability. In contrast, the other source ([2]) lists these five aspects as distinct, explicitly naming five validity threats. Thus, the text can be understood as either discussing one overarching threat that encompasses five aspects or as addressing five distinct threats.

Although a few sources ([4], [6], [7], [8], [11], and [25]) mention two or three evaluation methods in contexts that relate to other studies or publications, the prevailing information directly tied to the inquiry shows that the evaluation for “Microservice Architecture in Reality: An Industrial Inquiry” was conducted using one evaluation method. 

Thus, the coherent final answer is: one evaluation method was used in the evaluation ([1], [2], [3], [5], [9]–[10], [12]–[17], [19]–[24], [26]).

Although the sources refer to different papers, they all mention a set of threats to validity. When these threats are ranked in descending alphabetical order (from “Z” toward “A”), the combined list is as follows [1][2][3][4][5][6]:

  repeatability  
  internal validity  
  external validity  
  construct validity  
  confirmability

Some sources mention only a subset or assign different truth values to the individual threats. However, when we extract explicitly named aspects across the provided texts, the union of threats that appear is as given above, ranked from repeatability (which comes first alphabetically in descending order) down to confirmability.

According to source [1], the evaluation of ""Integrating Statistical Response Time Models in Architectural Performance Models"" was carried out using a technical experiment. This evaluation method notably focused on assessing a specific property, namely “Performance efficiency,” and did not follow an established guideline.

On the other hand, source [2] indicates that ""A Blockchain-Based Micro Economy Platform for Distributed Infrastructure Initiatives"" was evaluated using a case study approach. This evaluation encompassed a range of properties, each with potentially linked sub-properties—such as Functional Suitability, Performance efficiency, and Security—organized via an evaluation method list. 

In summary, while the response time models paper was evaluated through a technical experiment targeting only performance efficiency and lacking formal guidelines [1], the blockchain-based platform was evaluated through a case study that involved multiple properties and sub-properties [2].

• For 2020, several texts indicate that António Silva’s papers (e.g., the works referenced in [1], [4], and [8]) each contributed one research object (namely “First Research Object 2”). Thus, for 2020, his paper(s) investigated one research object.

• For 2019, one text ([9]) clearly states that a paper authored/co‐authored by António Silva contributed one research object (“First Research Object 2”). Therefore, for 2019 his paper investigated one research object.

No other publication years have explicit links tying António Silva to the investigation of research objects. 

In summary:
 – 2020: 1 research object  
 – 2019: 1 research object

The available details allow us to map the research‐object investigations to the following publication years:

• 2017: Several papers (e.g., those mentioned in [1], [3], [4], [5], [8], [16], and [17]) investigated “First Research Object 2.”  
• 2018: At least one paper investigated “First Research Object 2” ([10], [12], [24]) and another paper focused on a research object labeled “Architecture Decision Making” ([7]).  
• 2019: Multiple papers (as indicated in [11], [18], [20], [21], [23], [26], and [27]) contributed to research on “First Research Object 2.”  
• 2020: There are papers ([15] and [19]) in which “First Research Object 2” is the investigated object.  
• 2021: Several papers provide contributions—at least one investigating “First Research Object 2” (as shown in [2], [9], [13], and [25]) and another paper (as per [6]) investigating more than one object (specifically, “First Research Object 2” and “Second Research Object 2”), with [22] also identifying a paper published in 2021 though not detailing further objects.

Thus, based on the provided texts, the research objects investigated in Klym Shumaiev’s papers are distributed across the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, with the overwhelming majority of instances focusing on “First Research Object 2” (and in one case “Architecture Decision Making”) and one paper in 2021 addressing two objects simultaneously ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]).

• For 2021, two papers published by Mauro Caporuscio are identified. One paper (“A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures”) applies one evaluation method (Technical Experiment) [1], and another paper (“Trace Link Recovery for Software Architecture Documentation”) applies one evaluation method (Case Study) [15]. In total, 2 evaluation methods are applied in 2021.

• For 2020, three papers attributed to Mauro Caporuscio are available. One paper (“Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization”) applies one evaluation method (Case Study) [2], another paper (“Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly”) applies one evaluation method (Technical Experiment) [7], and a third paper (“Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis”) applies two evaluation methods (Questionnaire and Case Study) [11]. Together, the 2020 publications apply 4 evaluation methods.

• For 2018, there are two papers that are assumed to be among those published by Mauro Caporuscio. One paper (“Enabling Continuous Software Engineering for Embedded Systems Architectures with Virtual Prototypes”) employs one evaluation method (Motivating Example) [3], and another (“View-Centric Context Modeling to Foster the Engineering of Cyber-Physical System Networks”) applies one evaluation method (Case Study) [4]. In total, 2 evaluation methods are applied in 2018.

Note that the answer is organized by publication year, and for each year the numbers given below come from individual papers by Danny Weyns as reported in the texts. (Each bracketed number refers to the corresponding source.)

──────────────────────────────
• 2017  
 – One source [3] reports that a paper published in 2017 applied three evaluation approaches (Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview).  
 – Another source [9] reports a 2017 paper that applied two evaluation approaches (Benchmark and Technical Experiment).  
 – A third source [15] indicates a 2017 paper using one evaluation approach (Technical Experiment).  
 – Likewise, source [16] provides an instance with one evaluation approach (Grounded Theory) in a 2017 paper.  
 – In source [20] one 2017 paper is described in greater detail. (Here, if one interprets the information as five distinct evaluation approaches—Technical Experiment plus the four evaluation properties: Performance efficiency, Functional Suitability, Product Quality, and Usability—then this is the number given; an alternate reading would yield six if accounting separately for the “evaluation research” designation. For clarity, the synthesis here follows the interpretation of five explicit approaches.)  
 – Source [22] reports that another 2017 paper applied one evaluation approach (Case Study).  
 – Finally, source [24] presents a 2017 contribution that used one evaluation approach (Motivating Example).  

──────────────────────────────
• 2018  
 – Source [2] shows that a 2018 paper employed one evaluation approach (Case Study).  
 – Similarly, sources [14] and [17] report that the 2018 paper(s) each applied one evaluation approach (Case Study for both).  
 – Furthermore, source [23] describes a paper from 2018 that used one evaluation approach (Controlled Experiment).

──────────────────────────────
• 2019  
 – One source [7] reports that a 2019 paper applied two evaluation approaches (Focus Group and Questionnaire).  
 – Additionally, sources [8], [25], and [26] each describe a 2019 paper that employed one evaluation approach (respectively, Case Study or Technical Experiment).

──────────────────────────────
• 2020  
 – Source [4] indicates that a 2020 paper applied one evaluation approach (Technical Experiment).  
 – Source [13] reports that another 2020 paper applied two evaluation approaches (Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment).  
 – Sources [19], [21], and [29] each present a 2020 paper that used one evaluation approach (generally the Technical Experiment or Case Study, as specified).

──────────────────────────────
• 2021  
 – According to source [1], one 2021 paper applied two evaluation approaches (Technical Experiment and Questionnaire).  
 – In contrast, sources [5], [10], [11], [12], [27], and [28] each describe a 2021 paper that applied one evaluation approach (with the specific method being either Technical Experiment, Questionnaire, or Case Study).  
 – Source [6] reports a 2021 paper in which two distinct evaluation approaches (both involving the “Motivating Example” method for different contributions) were applied.

Summary

Because the texts report on different papers by Danny Weyns (sometimes within the same year) the number of evaluation approaches per paper varies. For example, in 2017 some papers were reported to have one, two, three, or even five distinct evaluation approaches, while in 2018 and most of the other years the papers were reported as having one or two evaluation approaches.

When answering “For each year, what is the number of evaluation approaches applied in papers published by Danny Weyns?” it is important to note that: 

– In 2017, reported numbers range from 1 up to 5 evaluation approaches (sources [3], [9], [15], [16], [20], [22], and [24]).  
– In 2018, all cited sources ([2], [14], [17], and [23]) report that the paper(s) applied 1 evaluation approach.  
– In 2019, while one paper is reported as using 2 evaluation approaches ([7]), the other reports ([8], [25], and [26]) indicate that 1 evaluation approach was applied.  
– For 2020, most sources ([4], [19], [21], [29]) indicate 1 evaluation approach, with one paper ([13]) applying 2 evaluation approaches.  
– In 2021, several papers are reported as applying 1 evaluation approach ([5], [10], [11], [12], [27], and [28]), with other contributions ([1] and [6]) applying 2 evaluation approaches.

• “A Blockchain‐Based Micro Economy Platform for Distributed Infrastructure Initiatives” [1]. This paper includes an evaluation explicitly for Security and employs input data that is verified as available.

• “Understanding Software Vulnerabilities Related to Architectural Security Tactics: An Empirical Investigation of Chromium, PHP and Thunderbird” [3]. This study evaluates Security (including a sub-property of Security) and is linked to input data that is noted as available.

• “Architectural Security Weaknesses in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) an Empirical Study Based on Disclosed Software Vulnerabilities” [4]. It evaluates Security (with explicit mention in one of its contributions) and, in at least one instance, has input data available.

The other partial answers either do not explicitly link an evaluation of the property Security with available input data or refer to papers evaluating other properties or containing input data without Security evaluations.

• “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” (as noted in [1]).  
• “Architecture-Centric Support for Integrating Security Tools in a Security Orchestration Platform” (see [2]).  
• “A Platform Architecture for Multi-Tenant Blockchain-Based Systems” (despite some conflicting notes, the overall conclusion in [4] is that it meets both criteria).  
• “A Blockchain‐Based Micro Economy Platform for Distributed Infrastructure Initiatives” (per [7]).  
• “COCOS: A Scalable Architecture for Containerized Heterogeneous Systems” (as reported in [9]).  
• “An Exploratory Study on Architectural Knowledge in Issue Tracking Systems” (see [11]).  
• “Improving the Consistency and Usefulness of Architecture Descriptions: Guidelines for Architects” (see [14]).  
• “Semi-automatic Feedback for Improving Architecture Conformance to Microservice Patterns and Practices” (per [18]).  
• “Continuous Adaptation Management in Collective Intelligence Systems” (as described in [20]).  
• “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions” (per [24]).  
• “QoS‐Based Formation of Software Architectures in the Internet of Things” (see [25]).  
• “Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly” (per [27]).

Each of these publications has been reported to evaluate a reference architecture with an evaluation property related to functional suitability while also contributing evidence in which input data is made available (even if some sources contained conflicting details, the explicitly “available” flag was clearly indicated in these cases).

Three of the responses ([1], [3], and [4]) state that one paper investigates the Security property (with [1] referring to the paper titled ""A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing,"" [3] mentioning ""A Platform Architecture for Multi-Tenant Blockchain-Based Systems,"" and [4] noting that one property is designated as Security). In contrast, [2] reports that two evaluations involving Security were conducted in one paper, while [5] indicates that there is no investigation of the property Security at all.

Thus, depending on which partial answer is given priority, the answer is either that one paper investigates Security (or one instance of Security is evaluated), that there are two evaluations of Security, or that no paper investigates Security. Without additional clarification to resolve these discrepancies, the evidence is inconclusive.

Several responses ([1], [3], [6], [8], [9], [10], [11], [13], [14], [16], [19], [20], [22], [23]) conclude that although one paper discusses repeatability as a validity threat, none of the papers showing that discussion use interviews in their evaluation. In contrast, other responses ([2], [4], [5], [7], [12], [15], [17], [18], [21]) report one paper per instance that meets both criteria.

When the responses are combined, the majority of the texts conclude that none of the papers that discuss repeatability as a validity threat employed interviews in their evaluation. 

Final Answer (citing sources): 0 papers use interviews in their evaluation for discussing repeatability as a validity threat ([1], [3], [6], [8], [9], [10], [11], [13], [14], [16], [19], [20], [22], [23]).

In several partial answers ([8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]) the evaluation methods noted do not include focus groups. Although a few earlier responses ([1]–[7]) suggest that one publication might meet both criteria, the majority of the texts show that there is no publication in which confirmability is identified as a validity threat while focus groups are employed for evaluation.

Answer: 0 publications meet both criteria.

In that case, this single instance does not appear to have used (or made available) input data, while no instance applying Data Science is reported as having made its input data available. 

However, other portions of the provided texts indicate that none of the papers expressly use the evaluation method Data Science—they mention methods such as “Technical Experiment” [2] and “Case Study” [3] instead. Thus, from that perspective there is no evidence available to compare the use versus non‐use of input data among papers applying the Data Science evaluation method.

In summary, if we follow the interpretation in [1] then the answer is: one paper did not use input data versus zero that made input data available. But if we follow the interpretations in [2] and [3], then there are no identified papers applying the Data Science method for which input data usage can be compared.

• Some partial answers indicate that among papers investigating Architecture Design Method there is one paper that has evaluated Portability while no paper has evaluated Usability ([2], [6], [7] in part).  
• In contrast, one source ([3]) claims that 0 papers evaluated Portability and 1 paper evaluated Usability, and another ([4], [9]) describes only an evaluation of Usability with no corresponding evaluation of Portability.  
• A different partial answer ([5]) reports that in one paper both properties were evaluated (one evaluation for Portability and one for Usability), while yet another ([8]) indicates that one evaluation for Portability was performed alongside two evaluations for Usability.  

Thus, as the supplied texts present conflicting counts—some sources report evaluations for Portability when none for Usability, others the reverse, and still others claim that both properties have been evaluated in the same paper—the overall answer cannot be stated unambiguously using the available partial answers.  
   
In summary, the provided partial answers do not agree on a single count: some indicate a scenario with Portability only (or more frequently) and others indicate a scenario with Usability only (or more frequently), with even a third scenario reporting one paper evaluating each property. Each source’s result is as follows:  
 – [2], [6], and part of [7] suggest 1 paper evaluated Portability and 0 Usability.  
 – [3] and [9] suggest 0 papers evaluated Portability and 1 paper evaluated Usability.  
 – [5] indicates 1 paper evaluated Portability and 1 paper evaluated Usability, while [8] indicates 1 evaluation for Portability versus 2 for Usability.  

Without additional clarification or a consensus among the provided texts, the final answer remains that the evaluations are reported inconsistently in the literature.

• One paper’s evaluation ([2]) reports two usability assessments but only one assessment for portability, while another paper ([5]) evaluates one usability aspect and one portability aspect. In other cases, such as in [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [10], [11], [12], and [14], the evaluations mention usability (or an equivalent “Quality in Use”) but do not mention any focus on portability.

• On the other side, one paper ([1]) explicitly describes two portability evaluations and no mention of usability; similarly, [9] and [13] point to evaluations focused on portability without any mention of usability.

Altogether, when considering the distinct papers mentioned in the texts, a focus on usability appears in the evaluations of papers referenced in [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [10], [11], [12], and [14] (making for a total of about 11 instances focused on usability), whereas a focus on portability is evident in the papers referred to in [1], [2], [5], [9], and [13] (about 5 instances).

• One source [4] explains that the paper titled ""Using Informal Knowledge for Improving Software Quality Trade-Off Decisions"" is associated with architecture evolution and explicitly states that its Evidence 2 does not use input data.

• Another source [18] indicates that ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring"" is a paper on architecture evolution where, despite one instance showing conflicting information, two descriptions explicitly mark its Evidence 2 as having input data that is not used.

• Similarly, source [19] reports that ""Continuous Architecture: Towards the Goldilocks Zone and Away from Vicious Circles"" is a work investigating architecture evolution in which the explicit flag for using input data is False—even though there is one note about its availability, the usage flag is taken as not used.

• Additionally, source [21] notes that ""Model‐Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" (which contributes to architectural topics and can be interpreted within an evolution context) has its input data attribute explicitly marked as not used (False), despite one conflicting mention regarding availability.

In summary, among the papers investigating architecture evolution provided in the texts, the following works are reported as not using input data (acknowledging that some sources include conflicting details):

 – ""Using Informal Knowledge for Improving Software Quality Trade-Off Decisions"" [4]  
 – ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring"" [18]  
 – ""Continuous Architecture: Towards the Goldilocks Zone and Away from Vicious Circles"" [19]  
 – ""Model‐Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" [21]

These four examples are the candidates from the provided texts where the evidence (despite some internal contradictions) most clearly indicates that input data was not used.

• “REST vs GraphQL: A Controlled Experiment” – Its evaluation uses a controlled experiment, and the accompanying evidence indicates that input data is not available ([1]).  
• “On the Understandability of Semantic Constraints for Behavioral Software Architecture Compliance: A Controlled Experiment” – A controlled experiment is applied and statements explicitly indicate that no input data is available ([2]).  
• “Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared” – This work applies a controlled experiment; despite one conflicting mention, clear statements show that the input data is not available ([3]).  
• “Continuous Analysis of Collaborative Design” – A controlled experiment is used (via its related contribution), and there is no mention of any input data being available ([4]).  
• “Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games” – Although one passage conflicts, two explicit descriptions state that input data is not available for its controlled experiment ([5]).  
• “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions” – Its controlled experiment contribution does not include any mention of input data ([6]).  
• “A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing” – While one conflicting note exists, there are explicit descriptions that for its experiment input data is not available ([7]).  
• “Mapping Features to Source Code through Product Line Architecture: Traceability and Conformance” – Its contribution evaluated by a controlled (technical) experiment shows no available input data ([8]).  
• “Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation” – The experiment (interpreted as controlled) is reported with input data marked as not available ([9]).  
• “Designing Robust Software Systems through Parametric Markov Chain Synthesis” – One of its contributions (evaluated by a technical experiment) has no input data indicated ([10]).  
• “Improving the Search for Architecture Knowledge in Online Developer Communities” – A controlled experiment is applied and some evidence (despite one conflicting mention) explicitly shows that input data is not available ([11]).  
• “Determination and Enforcement of Least-Privilege Architecture in Android” – For its contribution evaluated by a technical (controlled) experiment no input data is mentioned ([12]).  
• “Quantitative Verification-Aided Machine Learning: A Tandem Approach for Architecting Self-Adaptive IoT Systems” – The evaluation uses a technical experiment, and although one text conflicts, other explicit statements indicate no input data is available ([13]).  
• “A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures” – Its contribution evaluated via a technical experiment does not report any input data ([14]).  
• “COCOS: A Scalable Architecture for Containerized Heterogeneous Systems” – The paper applies a controlled experiment (via its First Research Object 2) with no associated available input data ([17]).  
• “A Platform Architecture for Multi-Tenant Blockchain-Based Systems” – Its contribution evaluated through a technical experiment has no mention of accompanying input data availability ([18]).  
• “Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” – This work uses a technical experiment and, with respect to the corresponding evidence, the input data is not available ([19]).  
• “A Flexible Architecture for Key Performance Indicators Assessment in Smart Cities” – Although one statement marks the input data as used, other explicit mentions note that—in the context of its technical (controlled) experiment—the input data is not available ([20]).  

Each of these papers is identified in the provided texts as applying a form of controlled (or technical) experiment while, for the experiment‐oriented contribution, the input data is either explicitly marked as “not available” or “False.”

Thus, the final answer is that Paper Class 2 is the most used paper class for papers that apply the evaluation method Case Study and investigate the research object Architecture Description (or its close variants).

One paper was published in 2020 [1] (""Architectural Technical Debt: A Grounded Theory"") and another in 2021 [8] (""Architectural Decay as Predictor of Issue- and Change-Proneness""). Although other texts provide publication years for various papers, none of them explicitly associate those works with investigating Technical Debt. Therefore, the explicit distribution by publication year for papers investigating Technical Debt is one from 2020 and one from 2021.

Additional publications from 2017 ([5]), 2020 ([6] and [9]), 2021 ([8] and [10]), and 2018 ([11]) likewise reference evaluation methods such as Case Study, Technical Experiment, Data Science, or other approaches, but not Benchmark. Thus, the overall frequency of papers applying the evaluation method ""Benchmark"" per publication year is 0 (see [1]–[11]).

Although many contributions mention a research object labeled “First Research Object 2” (whose associated Research Object Entity is given names such as “Reference Architecture,” “Architecture Analysis Method,” “Architecture Extraction,” “Architecture Design Method,” “Architectural Aspects,” “Architecture Evolution,” “Architecture Decision Making,” “Architectural Assumptions,” “Architecture Pattern,” or “Technical Debt”), almost every contribution comes from Paper Class 2, which is explicitly noted as not being a philosophical paper ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [19], [21], [23], [26], [27]). In only a few cases does there appear to be a designation possibly implying a philosophical paper (for example see [7], [22], [25]), but even then the explicit attributes or other contextual statements clarify that the paper’s “philosophical paper” flag is False.

Thus, the final answer is:

There is no explicitly stated research object that is investigated in a paper truly classified as a philosophical paper. All mentioned research objects (namely, “First Research Object 2” with its various associated entity names) are part of contributions from Paper Class 2—which, as specified in the texts, are not philosophical papers ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [19], [21], [23], [26], [27]).

For instance, several papers explicitly utilize a Technical Experiment approach [1], [5], [7], [11], [12], [19], [21], [28], [30]. In addition, some studies apply evaluations using a Questionnaire [2], [3], [15] or a Case Study methodology [2], [4], [6], [13], [16], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [29]. Other methods that appear include a Focus Group [3] and Interview techniques [3], [8], [10]. A Controlled Experiment was employed in some evaluations [5], [22], while Grounded Theory was specifically mentioned in one case [14]. Additionally, one paper used an Argumentation approach [9] along with a Motivating Example [9], [17]. Finally, a Field Experiment was noted in other papers [18], [20].

One source [1] indicates that two different evaluation methods were used – namely, Focus Group and Interview. In contrast, another source [2] states that only one evaluation method, Technical Experiment, is explicitly associated with evaluating this property. Therefore, the final answer depends on which source is referenced, as the published information presents two conflicting accounts.

For example, several sources state that only one evaluation method is explicitly mentioned—for instance, when the method is given as “Technical Experiment” or “Case Study” ([2], [3], [5], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [20], [21], [23], [25], [26], [27]). In contrast, a couple of sources report that two evaluation methods are mentioned (e.g., “Motivating Example” and “Technical Experiment” or “Technical Experiment” and “Controlled Experiment”) ([1], [6], [9]). Additionally, there are texts that describe three distinct evaluation methods (for example, “Focus Group”, “Questionnaire”, and “Interview”) ([4], [7]). 

Thus, depending on which parts of the texts are taken into account, the number of different evaluation methods applied ranges from one to three.

Although a few sources ([3], [7], [8]) mention two research objects, the majority of the texts, especially those that explicitly state evaluation in the context of compatibility, consistently refer only to the single research object. 

Thus, among those papers that evaluate compatibility, one research object is evaluated.

Among the papers that evaluate freedom from risk, the only explicitly mentioned evaluation method is Technical Experiment. In the one paper where the investigation of freedom from risk is explicitly evaluated (see [13]), the evaluation method used is Technical Experiment. Since there is only one such method provided (and when ranked in descending alphabetical order this single method trivially remains as Technical Experiment), the final ranked list is:

• Technical Experiment

92,f5d2a4751b650feada14d589c657be6b,c5a9135c-9007-4bf2-927e-85127fca519a,"Below is a synthesis of the reported findings. Many of the texts consistently report that the evaluation is applied on a research object called “First Research Object 2” (e.g., [2], [4], [6], [8], [10], [14], [16], [20], [22], [25], [26], [27]). In several cases this same object is further detailed via a Research Object List with an associated entity name. For example, one set of texts explains that the evaluation is applied on two objects—“First Research Object 2” and “Second Research Object 2” (see [1] and [3]). When these two are ranked in descending alphabetical order the result is:  
  • Second Research Object 2  
  • First Research Object 2

Other texts note that even when only a single research object is examined, it is sometimes “First Research Object 2” together with an additional associated name. For instance:  
  – “First Research Object 2” together with “Architecture Design Method” ([11] and [21]);  
  – “First Research Object 2” together with “Architecture Decision Making” ([12], [24], [19]);  
  – “First Research Object 2” along with “Architectural Assumptions” ([6]);  
  – “First Research Object 2” plus “Architecture Analysis Method” ([7], [15], [23]);  
  – “First Research Object 2” with “Architecture Evolution” ([9]);  
  – “First Research Object 2” with “Architecture Description” ([28]); and  
  – “First Research Object 2” with “Architecture Pattern” ([13]).  

In every such case only one evaluation is reported, so if only one item (or paired items) is present then that single (or paired) list is the answer. For example, in [5] the object “Architecture Design Method” is the one on which the evaluation is performed, and when paired with the alternative “First Research Object 2” (as in [11] or [21]) descending alphabetical order is obtained by comparing the names letter‐by‐letter (noting that “First Research Object 2” begins with “F” while names like “Architecture …” begin with “A”).

Thus, synthesizing the information we have two main situations:

1. In the cases where two distinct research objects are explicitly mentioned, the descending alphabetical order is:  
  • Second Research Object 2  
  • First Research Object 2              [1], [3]

2. In the cases where only one research object is explicitly mentioned the object is “First Research Object 2” (possibly further identified by an associated Research Object Entity such as “Architecture Design Method”, “Architecture Decision Making”, “Architectural Assumptions”, “Architecture Analysis Method”, “Architecture Evolution”, “Architecture Description”, or “Architecture Pattern”). When two names (one the contribution name and one its associated entity) are provided, the descending alphabetical order is determined by comparing the two strings. For example, when “First Research Object 2” is paired with “Architecture Design Method” the descending order is:  
  • First Research Object 2  
  • Architecture Design Method       [11], [21]

Because many texts report only “First Research Object 2” as the evaluated object (see [2], [4], [8], [10], [14], [16], [20], [22], [25]–[27]), that name by itself is also a valid answer, trivially ranked in descending alphabetical order.

In summary, depending on which publications are considered the answer can be stated in one of two ways:

A. If one considers all publications that explicitly list two research objects, then the descending alphabetical order is:  
  “Second Research Object 2”, “First Research Object 2” [1], [3].

B. If one considers the many cases where only one evaluation is performed (often on “First Research Object 2”, sometimes annotated with an associated entity name), then the answer is “First Research Object 2” (or, if paired with its associated name, the descending order is achieved by comparing that name with “First Research Object 2”, for example: “First Research Object 2” followed by “Architecture Design Method” [11], [21]).

• One set of texts [1, 3, 5, 6, 16] indicates that within a single evaluation of a contribution (First Research Object 2), both the property Satisfaction and the property Context Coverage are each evaluated once.  
• In contrast, several other texts [2, 4, 7–15, 17–27] do not provide explicit information about both properties in a way that enables a direct frequency comparison. Some mention evaluating Satisfaction without any reference to Context Coverage, while others mention only Context Coverage.  
• Moreover, although the question focuses on papers investigating Architecture Evolution, several of the provided texts relate either to different research objects or do not explicitly state that both properties are evaluated in that context.

Thus, insofar as the texts reveal, when both properties are evaluated—as explicitly described in one case—they occur with equal frequency (once each). However, because not all texts provide data on both properties (or on Architecture Evolution), there is no consistent or additional explicit frequency comparison beyond noting that in one evaluation the two properties appear equally (once each) [1, 3, 5, 6, 16].

In these cases, the evaluations indicate an equal treatment of the two aspects.

However, some partial answers point out that in other studies only one of the two aspects is explicitly mentioned (with some texts noting the explicit evaluation of context coverage [2], [4], [8] and others only describing satisfaction [12]–[16], [18]–[20]). This suggests that while certain publications investigating architecture patterns include both evaluation properties—yielding a one‐to‐one comparison—in other cases only one appears within the provided texts. 

Thus, among the publications that investigate architecture patterns and evaluate both properties, satisfaction is evaluated as often as context coverage (each once).

• In several instances the texts indicate that only maintainability is explicitly evaluated, with no mention of usability (see [1], [4], [5], [7], [8]).  
• Conversely, some publications explicitly evaluate usability while not evaluating maintainability (see [2], [3], [6], [15], [16]).  
• In at least one publication, both usability and maintainability are evaluated, and in that study they are measured once each ([9], [11]).  

Thus, among publications using controlled experiments, some studies focus solely on one property (either maintainability or usability) while one study explicitly assesses both equally. There is no overall trend showing that one property is evaluated more often than the other; it ultimately depends on the specific evaluation design of each publication.

• Several texts indicate that one set of papers explicitly evaluated Technical Debt (or a corresponding research object) using a property identified as “Accuracy” and another identified as “Quality of Method” ([1], [6], [7], and [11]).  
• Other texts describe evaluations in which the properties “Maintainability” and “Product Quality” were examined in studies on Technical Debt (or contexts equivalent to it) without following a guideline ([2] and [5]).  
• In one case study of a related research object, a broader set of properties was reported—including “Effectiveness,” “Quality in Use,” “Satisfaction,” and “Maintainability” (in addition to “Product Quality”)—again without adherence to an evaluation guideline ([9]).  

In summary, depending on the specific study, the non‐guideline‐based evaluations have focused on properties such as Accuracy, Quality of Method, Maintainability, and Product Quality, with some reports also including additional aspects such as Effectiveness, Quality in Use, and Satisfaction ([1], [2], [5], [6], [7], and [9]).

In many cases the publications investigating architectural assumptions report that their evaluation was conducted without following a guideline, and in those cases a range of properties was assessed. For example, some evaluations examined:

• Performance efficiency (explicitly mentioned in [1], [5], [8], [14], [17], [18], [21], [23], [26], [30])  
• Product Quality (mentioned across [1], [2], [3], [7], [9], [13], [14], [15], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [23], [26], [30])  
• Functional Suitability (reported in [2], [3], [7], [13], [19], [20], [26], [30])  
• Quality in Use (appearing in [3], [6], [7], [8], [11], [12], [17], [18], [27])  
• Satisfaction (noted in [3], [11], [17], [18])  
• Quality of Method (found in [7], [8], [14], [15], [21], [22], [23], [25], [27])  
• Accuracy (listed in [7], [8], [15], [21], [23], [25], [27])  

Other publications reported evaluations without guidelines that covered additional properties, including:  
• Usability ([5], [19])  
• Reliability ([5], [15])  
• Security (or a sub‐property of Security, [5], [9])  
• Maintainability ([5], [24])  
• Effectiveness ([6], [24])  
• Efficiency (as a distinct entry in [3] and [27])  
• Context coverage ([3], [12], [17])  
• Recovery (mentioned in [8])  
• Robustness (along with a sub‐property, [22])  
• And even an evaluation aspect noted as “Validity 2” (which, along with other properties, is reported in [7] and [30]).  

In summary, among publications investigating architectural assumptions it is clear from the provided excerpts (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11]–[14], [15], [17]–[19], [20]–[23], [24]–[27], [30]) that without following a guideline the evaluations have covered a broad range of properties. These include Performance efficiency, Product Quality, Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, Satisfaction, Quality of Method, Accuracy, as well as additional properties such as Usability, Reliability, Security, Maintainability, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Context coverage, Recovery, Robustness, and even an evaluation aspect captured as “Validity 2.”

Each of these properties was reported in a different context as having been assessed without adherence to a guiding protocol for the evaluation.

For example, sources [2], [3], [4], [6], [8], [12], [13], [14], [16], [19], [21], and [23] explicitly state that First Research Object 2 was evaluated in an evaluation whose “Has Guideline” flag was False. In addition, a number of texts (see [1], [3], [5], [7], [9], [11], and [15]) report that Second Research Object 2 was also evaluated without using a guideline.

It is important to note that a few sources ([10], [17], [18], and [24]) provide a contrasting view by indicating either the use of a guideline in some instances or by not mentioning any research object undergoing evaluation without a guideline.

In summary, among the publications applying grounded theory in their evaluation the most consistently reported research object evaluated without using a guideline is First Research Object 2; and in several instances Second Research Object 2 is also evaluated without a guideline. One source even mentions an evaluation of an object referred to as Validity 2 without a guideline ([20]). 

Thus, while there is some variability in the reports, the aggregated evidence shows that First Research Object 2 is most frequently evaluated without using a guideline, and, in certain contexts, Second Research Object 2 (and on one occasion, an object labeled Validity 2) is also evaluated without an accompanying guideline.

In a subset of the texts the research object is explicitly described as Technical Debt, and in that context the only explicit properties that are mentioned are “Maintainability” and “Product Quality” [1]. Other texts, however, discuss evaluation properties for a research object labeled “First Research Object 2” that do not explicitly refer to Technical Debt. These documents list properties such as Accuracy and Quality of Method [2], Functional Suitability (mentioned in several texts, for example [3], [5], [9], [15]), and even additional properties like Performance efficiency, Effectiveness, Quality in Use, Satisfaction, and aspects of Threats To Validity ([4], [6], [7], [11], [12], [14], [16], [21], [23], [24], [26]). 

Because the question specifically asks for the properties most often investigated for Technical Debt, we must restrict our answer to those texts that explicitly link evaluation properties to that research object. In that case, the texts that clearly refer to Technical Debt indicate that the evaluation investigates Maintainability and Product Quality [1]. 

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, the properties most often investigated for Technical Debt are Maintainability and Product Quality [1].

However, in several cases—from multiple evaluations—the most frequently mentioned properties are Product Quality and Functional Suitability [1,3,9,10,18]. Other properties that have been evaluated include Performance efficiency, Accuracy, Quality of Method, Quality in Use, Effectiveness, Security, Usability, Satisfaction, Context coverage, Recovery, Efficiency, and others. Nonetheless, as several sources consistently show that Product Quality and Functional Suitability have been evaluated multiple times in different publication contexts [1,3,9,10,18], these appear to be the evaluation properties that have been most often examined among publications investigating architectural assumptions.

The texts show that the evaluation of the architecture decision‐making investigation was described in different ways. Several sources explicitly state that the investigation was evaluated by examining a property referred to as “Quality in Use” (e.g., [1], [7], [10], [11], [17]). In some accounts, this evaluation is further characterized by a sub‐property named “Effectiveness” (as noted in [1] and [13]). Although other properties—such as “Functional Suitability,” “Product Quality,” “Quality of Method,” “Accuracy,” and others—are mentioned in various texts evaluating related contributions, the most commonly and explicitly evaluated property in relation to the architecture decision‐making investigation in the target paper appears to be “Quality in Use” (with the additional note of “Effectiveness” as a sub‐property) [1], [7], [10], [13], [17].

Several texts explicitly state that the evaluation of the research object associated with First Research Object 2 (which is linked with the object named “Architecture Analysis Method” in some instances or a closely related name in others) is performed using an Evaluation Method List. In many instances the Evaluation Method Entity selected from that list is named “Case Study” ([3], [4], [8], [11], [12], [13], [20], [22]). For example, text [3] explains that because the Evaluation Method List includes an entity named “Case Study” and the research object is one of those evaluated, the method applied is the case study. Texts [4] and [8] similarly state that the evaluation method used is “Case Study.”

It is important to note that other partial answers mention alternative evaluation methods such as “Technical Experiment” ([2], [6], [9], [10], [14], [17]) and even “Motivating Example” ([1], [19]) or “Grounded Theory” ([5]). In one case ([7]) a “Controlled Experiment” is mentioned; yet, each of these comes from contexts in which either the research object or the paper title slightly diverges from the one in the question. In particular, some texts point out that the paper title and the research object name in the question (“Architecture Analysis Method” in “Accurate Analysis of Quality Properties of Software with Observation-Based Markov Chain Refinement”) do not perfectly match the texts provided.

Given these discrepancies, many of the partial answers that explicitly connect the evaluation method to an evaluation process involving First Research Object 2 indicate that “Case Study” is the evaluation method used. Therefore, based solely on the majority of the provided evidence where an Evaluation Method Entity named “Case Study” is employed, we conclude that:

The evaluation method applied to evaluate the research object “Architecture Analysis Method” (as described within contexts associated with First Research Object 2) is, by most accounts, a Case Study ([3], [4], [8], [11], [12], [13], [20], [22]).

However, it must be noted that the texts present some inconsistencies—mentioning “Technical Experiment” and other methods in other contexts—and they do not explicitly reference the research object or the paper title exactly as stated in the question.

Some texts attribute the evaluation method to a Case Study [1, 5, 7, 9] while others indicate that a Technical Experiment was used [3, 4, 6]. Additional texts even mention alternative evaluation methods such as Focus Group [8] and Grounded Theory [10]. It is also important to note that many of the texts refer to systems or papers other than FLRA, which makes it difficult to determine with certainty which method applies specifically to the FLRA reference architecture. Therefore, the information supplied is inconsistent and does not allow for a clear, unique answer regarding the evaluation method for the FLRA paper.

• Focus Group – Several texts indicate that a Focus Group was used (e.g., [1], [3], [6], [15]).  
• Questionnaire – At least one source explicitly reports the use of a Questionnaire in the evaluation (e.g., [1], [14]).  
• Interview – A number of texts describe an evaluation method based on interviews (e.g., [3], [11], [12], [25]).  
• Grounded Theory – One paper is reported to have applied Grounded Theory in its evaluation (e.g., [13]).  
• Data Science – One source notes that an evaluation method called Data Science was used in one of the investigations (e.g., [7]).  
• Case Study – Multiple texts describe the use of a Case Study as the chosen evaluation method (e.g., [5], [20], [21], [24], [27]).  
• Technical Experiment – A number of texts mention a Technical Experiment as the evaluation method (e.g., [10], [28], [30]).  
• Field Experiment – In one paper, a Field Experiment was selected to evaluate Architecture Decision Making (e.g., [16]).  
• Argumentation – One source explicitly identifies an evaluation method named Argumentation (e.g., [18]).  

Each of these methods appears in the context of evaluating contributions related to Architecture Decision Making in various papers co-authored by or involving Uwe Zdun.

In some contributions this was done through a Case Study approach [1,5,8,13,14,16,17], while in other cases the evaluation method was explicitly reported as Grounded Theory [2,4]. A considerable number of studies employed a Technical Experiment to assess the Accuracy property [3,7,9,10,11,15,18,20,22,26,27,30]. In addition, at least one contribution applied an evaluation method based on Data Science [6,29] and another mentioned the use of the Benchmark method [19]. There are also instances where evaluation methods such as Argumentation [20] and Controlled Experiment [28] were applied, and in one exploratory study, methods including Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview were used [21,23,25]. 

Thus, across his publications, Duc Le applies a diverse set of evaluation methods—ranging from Case Study and Grounded Theory through Technical Experiment to Data Science, Benchmark, Argumentation, Controlled Experiment, and qualitative approaches—to assess the property of Accuracy on the investigated objects.

For example, some studies used methods involving direct user input such as Interview (e.g., [1], [19], [22]), while others applied experimental techniques such as Technical Experiment (e.g., [2], [5], [9], [15], [16]) and Controlled Experiment (e.g., [4], [10], [11], [13], [28]). Several works relied on a Case Study approach to conduct their evaluations (e.g., [3], [8], [12], [17], [18], [27], [30]). In addition, some studies integrated other methods into their evaluation frameworks including Questionnaire (e.g., [6], [21], [29]), Field Experiment (e.g., [20], [23]), Argumentation (e.g., [11]), Focus Group (e.g., [21], [24]), Grounded Theory (e.g., [25]), and Data Science (e.g., [26]). 

Overall, the applied methods range across qualitative techniques such as Interview, Focus Group, and Case Study, as well as more controlled experimental approaches like Technical Experiment, Controlled Experiment, and Field Experiment, with additional support from methods such as Questionnaire, Argumentation, Grounded Theory, and Data Science to structure and validate the usability evaluations.

Some texts indicate that the method was evaluated using a Technical Experiment (e.g., [2], [3], [4], [8], [9], [11], [14]), while other sources report that a Case Study evaluation was applied (e.g., [5], [6], [7], [12], [15], [16], [17], [18], [21], [28], [29]). In addition, a few passages mention alternative or complementary evaluation approaches such as a Controlled Experiment ([1]), Grounded Theory ([10]), Motivating Example ([13]), and Data Science ([19]). There is also mention in one instance of evaluation techniques including Focus Groups, Questionnaires, and Interviews ([22], [27]). 

Thus, according to the provided texts, Stephan Seifermann’s evaluation of the Architecture Analysis Method involves primarily the use of a Technical Experiment and a Case Study, with isolated references to other evaluation methods in specific contexts.

For example, several sources state that the evaluation employed an Evaluation Method List whose sole Evaluation Method Entity was named either “Case Study” [1], [2], [5], [8], [10] or “Technical Experiment” [9], [11], [13], [14], [16], [17]. Although a couple of partial answers [6] and [12] mention additional evaluation methods in other contexts, these sources do not explicitly link those methods to the evaluation of Efficiency. Thus, based on the texts provided, the author applied one evaluation method in the papers that evaluate the property Efficiency.

Some partial answers report that three or two different methods have been applied ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5]), while many others indicate that exactly one evaluation method was explicitly mentioned for the property ""Satisfaction"" ([6], [7], [8], [10]–[13], [14]–[18], [19]–[30]). Note that in several cases the texts list multiple evaluation methods as part of an overall evaluation process, yet only one method is explicitly tied to evaluating the property satisfaction. For example, sources [14] and [16] explicitly associate a single named method (“Motivating Example” in [14] or “Technical Experiment” in [16]) with the evaluation of satisfaction. Other sources ([6], [7], [13], [21], [26]) similarly identify only one method (often “Case Study”) being used in the context of satisfaction.

Thus, based solely on the explicit statements in the provided texts, the coherent conclusion is that only one evaluation method has been applied by Georg Buchgeher to evaluate the property satisfaction ([6], [7], [8], [10]–[13], [14]–[18], [19]–[30]).

Some of the partial answers indicate that only one evaluation method was applied (for example, a “Technical Experiment” [8], [14], [16], [17]), while other texts report that two different evaluation methods were used (for example, “Technical Experiment” together with “Argumentation” or “Motivating Example” as mentioned in [1], [3], [6], [15]). 

Based solely on the provided texts, it is not possible to definitively decide between one and two. However, because multiple sources explicitly cite two distinct evaluation methods in the context of evaluating architecture patterns, one may conclude that Stefan Kugele applied two different evaluation methods.

Several texts report that one evaluation method was applied – for example, a Questionnaire [1], Interview [2, 5, 10], Focus Group [3, 9, 16], Argumentation [7], Technical Experiment [8], Grounded Theory [11], Field Experiment [12], or Data Science [13], among others. In contrast, a few sources indicate that two evaluation methods were used (for example, Focus Group and Interview [4, 15] or Benchmark and Technical Experiment [14], and even Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment [6]). 

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, some evaluations of Architecture Decision Making by Ingo Weber appear to use a single evaluation method, while other texts report two methods being applied. (See [1]–[3], [5], [7]–[13], [16] for the “one method” accounts and [4], [6], [14], [15] for the “two methods” accounts.)

Several sources have reported evaluation properties investigated (in some cases with minor discrepancies), but a common set of properties that appears in multiple contributions is as follows. When the properties are ranked in descending alphabetical order (from letters closer to Z down to A), one group of sources consistently lists:

 • Product Quality  
 • Performance efficiency  
 • Functional Suitability

For example, sources [11], [24], and [27] explicitly identify these three properties as being investigated by applying the Technical Experiment evaluation method and state that in descending alphabetical order the list is: Product Quality, Performance efficiency, Functional Suitability.

It is worth noting that other partial answers provided differing sets (for example, [1] mentions Accuracy and Quality of Method, while others include additional properties such as Effectiveness or Quality in Use), but the synthesis combining the provided texts most commonly converges on the above three properties for the Technical Experiment evaluation. 

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, the evaluation properties investigated by Andreas Burger using the Technical Experiment method—in descending alphabetical order—are: Product Quality, Performance efficiency, and Functional Suitability [11], [24], [27].

Some texts indicate that in 2018 there was at least one investigation of architecture patterns (for example, one instance is noted in [5] and another in [8]), whereas other sources for 2018 do not provide clear information on an investigation count ([1], [3], [7], [11]). In 2020, at least one paper explicitly includes an investigation of architecture patterns (as described in [6]), while several texts only mention 2020 publications that do not discuss architecture patterns ([2], [9], [10], [12]). 

Thus, while there is explicit evidence of an architecture pattern investigation in 2020 ([6]) and at least one instance in 2018 ([5] and [8]), the texts do not offer comprehensive numerical counts for either year. Without further details, a direct numerical comparison could not be established beyond these isolated instances.

Two sources [2] and [6] indicate that the ""Questionnaire"" method is used in a paper published in 2021, while they do not report any instance for the year 2020. In contrast, one source [3] claims that a paper published in 2020 applied the ""Questionnaire"" method (once), with no evidence for any 2021 paper using it. Other sources ([1], [4], [5], and [7]) do not mention the ""Questionnaire"" method at all for either year. 

Thus, the final answer is that according to some texts the ""Questionnaire"" method is applied in 2021 but not in 2020, whereas one source suggests a single instance in 2020 with no corresponding application in 2021.

• Some sources indicate that one of the research objects was investigated without an evaluation method. For example, sources [1], [4], and [5] consistently identify “Second Research Object 2” (alternatively named “Architecture Extraction”) as the object for which an evaluation method is marked as false (i.e. no evaluation method was applied). 

• Other texts (for example, sources [3], [6], [18], [22], and [25]) refer instead to “Paper Class 2” as the contribution whose evaluation research attribute is set to False, thereby implying that no evaluation method is applied in that case.

• In contrast, a number of other sources (such as [2], [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [16], [17], [19], [20], [21], [23], [24], [26], [28] among others) state that the explicitly named research object—“First Research Object 2” (with various associated entity names)—has indeed been evaluated using one or several evaluation methods (e.g. a Technical Experiment, a Case Study, Controlled Experiment, or Grounded Theory). One instance ([15]) even notes that although one description of First Research Object 2 lacks an accompanying evaluation method, other descriptions clearly document its evaluation.

In summary, there is disagreement among the partial answers. According to some sources ([1], [4], [5]) the research object without an applied evaluation method is “Second Research Object 2,” while others ([3], [6], [18], [22], [25]) indicate that “Paper Class 2” is not evaluated. At the same time, many texts assert that First Research Object 2 is always evaluated. 

Thus, the final answer depends on which evidence one emphasizes. If one accepts the descriptions that mark a contribution as “not evaluation research” (using the attribute set to False), then the research object to which no evaluation method has been applied is either “Second Research Object 2” ([1], [4], [5]) or “Paper Class 2” ([3], [6], [18], [22], [25]). Conversely, several sources report that every explicitly named research object (namely First Research Object 2) received an evaluation method.

All told, the partial answers do not unanimously agree; the two main candidates mentioned for having no evaluation are Second Research Object 2 (Architecture Extraction) and Paper Class 2, depending on the source cited.

• Technical Experiment – Several sources clearly report that this method was used without an evaluation guideline ([1], [2], [4], [6], [8], [10], [15], [17], [18], [21], [22], [25], [28]).  
• Case Study – Multiple texts indicate that evaluations using the Case Study method were performed without any guideline ([3], [5], [13], [16], [19], [20], [24], [26], [27]).  
• Motivating Example – This method was used for one research object and was applied with no evaluation guideline ([1], [14]).  
• Questionnaire – One text explicitly mentions that a Questionnaire was used in an evaluation without an associated guideline ([9]).  
• Controlled Experiment – At least one instance, as noted in one of the texts, was performed without an evaluation guideline ([12]).  
• Grounded Theory – Although one text noted that an evaluation using Grounded Theory had its guideline set to True ([7]), another source explicitly states that Grounded Theory was applied without an evaluation guideline ([23], [30]).  

Thus, the evaluation methods used by Muhammad Babar that were not applied with an evaluation guideline are Technical Experiment, Case Study, Motivating Example, Questionnaire, Controlled Experiment, and (in at least one reported instance) Grounded Theory.[1][2][3][4][5][6][8][9][10][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][30]

• Questionnaire  
 – Listed as an evaluation method applied without a guideline in the contributions reported in ([6], [10], [22]).  

• Verification  
 – Reported in the context of an evaluation without a guideline alongside Technical Experiment ([7]).  

• Motivating Example  
 – Used in evaluations of multiple research objects without a guideline ([8]).  

• Argumentation  
 – Mentioned as an evaluation method from an Evaluation Method List without an accompanying guideline ([14]).

In many cases the publication includes two contributions, one being “Evidence 2” (which is explicitly linked to—and sometimes even marked as using—input data) and the other being a research object that shows no such association. For example:

• Some texts indicate that both First Research Object 2 (e.g., when described as “Architecture Analysis Method,” “Architecture Design Method,” or “Architecture Description”) and Second Research Object 2 (when described as “Architecture Pattern,” “Architectural Aspects,” or “Architecture Extraction”) are presented without any reference to using input data ([1], [2], [3], [4], [11], [15]). 

• In other instances, only the contribution labeled First Research Object 2 is presented without any link to input data use ([5], [7], [9], [12], [13], [16]–[14], [17]–[25]). 

Thus, a final answer that synthesizes all the provided partial answers is as follows:

In publications from Davide Arcelli the investigated research objects that are not linked to input data are primarily the contributions identified as First Research Object 2. (Depending on the publication, First Research Object 2 may be described with the names “Architecture Analysis Method,” “Architecture Design Method,” or “Architecture Description.”) In some studies, a Second Research Object 2 is also investigated without employing input data. In contrast, the contribution labeled Evidence 2 is explicitly associated with using input data.

For example:

• Some texts emphasize Accuracy—as it is defined with a sub‐property and is highlighted explicitly in multiple descriptions ([3], [15], [17], [26]).  
• Other accounts focus on Functional Suitability, presenting it with additional detail (via sub‐property elaboration) and suggesting it is a primary focus in some evaluations ([1], [25], [27]).  
• Several texts instead highlight Effectiveness, again citing its presentation as including a sub‐property and indicating it is prominent in the evaluation framework ([2], [11], [14], [24]).  

Additional properties such as Product Quality, Quality of Method, Compatibility, and others are also mentioned ([4], [9], [10], [13], [20], [28]), but without any evidence to show that they are more frequently evaluated than the detailed properties noted above.

Thus, while individual contributions sometimes stress Accuracy, Functional Suitability, or Effectiveness, there is no unambiguous frequency count to conclusively single out one property. That said, several texts ([3], [15], [17], [26]) provide recurring evidence that Accuracy is explicitly and in detail evaluated in the context of architecture analysis methods. 

In summary, based solely on the provided texts, the evidence most strongly supports Accuracy as the property most often evaluated, although it must be noted that other properties (such as Functional Suitability and Effectiveness) are also explicitly considered in these evaluations.

Several texts explicitly state that for papers classified as having a proposal of solution (Paper Class 2) and where the contribution under evaluation is associated with the research object related to architecture (even though the exact naming sometimes varies), the primary evaluation method is “Case Study” [1], [9], [10], [12], [15], [22]. In these contexts the evaluation was carried out by means of an Evaluation Method List that includes a “Case Study” entity, and at least one paper meeting the criteria (i.e. Paper Class 2 with proposal of solution true) used “Case Study” as its evaluation method.

There is also some mention of “Technical Experiment” in related texts [3], [13], [17] and others. However, when the requirements are combined—namely, papers with a proposal of solution and whose investigated research object is in the architecture domain (here understood as Architecture Extraction or its close variants)—the most frequently and explicitly stated evaluation method is “Case Study.”

Thus, based solely on the explicit information provided in the texts:

• The evaluation method that has been applied the most in papers with the paper class proposal of solution (Paper Class 2) and the investigated research object related to architecture (Architecture Extraction or similar) is “Case Study” [1], [9], [10], [12], [15], [22].

On one hand, one source ([1]) states that the paper “Architectural Security Weaknesses in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) an Empirical Study Based on Disclosed Software Vulnerabilities” was published in 2019 and that its research object was evaluated using an evaluation method named Data Science. In addition, two other sources report that two different papers published in 2021 were evaluated using Data Science—one by [3] (“Architectural Decay as Predictor of Issue- and Change-Proneness”) and one by [4] (the FLRA paper). On the other hand, several sources ([2], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]) either mention no instance of an evaluation using the Data Science method for any publication year between 2019 and 2021 or limit themselves to other evaluation methods and/or publication years.

Thus, synthesizing the available information yields the following counts:
 • 2019: 1 instance (per [1])
 • 2020: 0 instances (no text provides any evidence)
 • 2021: 2 instances (one each per [3] and [4])

• One source ([1]) indicates that a research object (referred to as First Research Object 2) was evaluated using the Argumentation method and published in 2020.  
• In contrast, another source ([2]) identifies the same research object as having been published in 2019.  
• The remaining sources ([3], [4], [5], and [6]) do not mention Argumentation as an evaluation method at all, instead referring to other methods (such as Technical Experiment, Focus Group, Questionnaire) or providing no details about Argumentation.

In summary, while one report attributes an Argumentation evaluation to a single research object with conflicting publication years (2019 or 2020), the other sources offer no supporting information for any research object evaluated with Argumentation between 2019 and 2021.

Several publications evaluating compatibility were published in 2017. In these cases, a wide variety of evaluation methods were applied. For example, some studies used methods such as Technical Experiment (as noted in [2], [16], [17]), Verification ([2]), Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview ([4]), Case Study ([5], [18]), Grounded Theory ([12]), Field Experiment ([15]), and even Data Science ([20]). Furthermore, one publication in 2017 applied multiple methods concurrently (for instance, one study combined Technical Experiment, Questionnaire, and Controlled Experiment, as reported in [11]). Additionally, another 2017 study used the Motivating Example method ([9]).

In contrast, publications from the period 2018 report a more limited range of evaluation methods. One paper published in 2018 applied Technical Experiment together with Controlled Experiment ([3]), while another publication from 2018 only mentioned the application of a Controlled Experiment ([10]).

For 2019, the available evidence is based on two publications. One publication published in 2019 applied Technical Experiment ([7] and [14]), while another reported the use of a Case Study ([19]). 

In summary, among the publications that evaluate compatibility:  
• In 2017, a broad spectrum of evaluation methods—such as Technical Experiment, Verification, Focus Group, Questionnaire, Interview, Case Study, Grounded Theory, Field Experiment, Data Science, and Motivating Example—were applied.  
• In 2018, the evaluation methods reported were mainly Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment.  
• In 2019, the evaluation methods used were Technical Experiment and Case Study.

This distribution is based solely on the details provided in the texts ([1]–[20]).

In particular, source [1] states that “Architectural Patterns for Cross‐Domain Personalised Automotive Functions” was published in 2020 and that its evaluation employed the Argumentation method. Similarly, source [2] reports that “Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games” (2020) applied the evaluation method Argumentation. In addition, source [7] claims that “Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation” was published in 2020 and applied the evaluation method Argumentation.

It is important to note that several other sources either mention papers from different years, describe other evaluation methods, or state that no paper in 2020 used Argumentation. However, strictly regarding the information from sources [1], [2], and [7], these are the papers identified as having applied the evaluation method Argumentation in the publication year 2020.

Two texts ([2] and [6]) indicate that one paper from 2018 applied the evaluation method Controlled Experiment. However, the remaining texts ([1], [3], [4], [5], [7]–[18]) consistently report that no paper published in 2018 employed the evaluation method Controlled Experiment.

Thus, although there are two partial answers reporting one paper, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that there is no unambiguous instance of a 2018 paper using the Controlled Experiment evaluation method. 

Final Answer (citing sources): Based on the provided texts, 0 papers applied the evaluation method Controlled Experiment in the publication year 2018 [1], [3]–[5], [7]–[18]; note that while [2] and [6] report one paper each, the overall evidence does not conclusively support this.

However, one source ([5]) presents a different account. According to [5], the paper “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” is described as having a paper class that is noted as a personal experience paper and it applied the Technical Experiment evaluation method. Its publication year is given as 2020.

Thus, if we follow [5] the single paper that meets both criteria—having a paper class of personal experience paper and applying the Technical Experiment evaluation method—is “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” (2020). In descending order by publication year, this paper ranks first (and is the only candidate).

Citations: [5], with the other sources consistently noting that in all other cases the paper class is not a personal experience paper.

• Two sources ([1] and [2]) state that at least one paper investigating Architecture Evolution was published in 2020 and none in 2021.  
• In contrast, sources [4] and [5] report a paper investigating Architecture Evolution published in 2021 (with no corresponding paper for 2020).  
• Additional sources ([3], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10]) either report papers in other years or state that there is no explicit evidence of any paper on Architecture Evolution for 2020 or 2021.

Because the available texts are conflicting—with some partial answers indicating one paper in 2020 and none in 2021, and others indicating one paper in 2021 and none in 2020 (or none for both years)—any final answer depends on which sources are given greater weight.

If we rely solely on [1] and [2], one paper was published in 2020 while no paper was published in 2021. 

Thus, one coherent final answer (with citations) is: According to sources [1] and [2], the research object Architecture Evolution is investigated in one paper published in 2020 and in 0 papers in 2021.

Other sources ([5], [7], [8]) indicate that none of the mentioned papers from either year explicitly evaluates Maintainability, and source [6] refers to an evaluation performed in 2018. 

Thus, due to these conflicting accounts, the texts do not provide consistent or sufficient information to definitively state how many papers evaluated the property Maintainability in 2017 compared to 2020 [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].

• It was published in 2017,  
• It investigates the research object “Architecture Design Method” (or its corresponding variant “Architecture Analysis Method” as assumed in one instance), and  
• It has not used input data.

Several sources ([1], [2], [5], [6], [9]–[12], [13]–[22]) explain that while some papers from 2017 look at a research object related to architecture design or analysis, either their publication year does not match, they address a different research object, or they include a contribution that uses input data. Some individual partial answers ([3], [4], [7], [8], [20]) mention candidate papers; however, these candidates are contradicted or disqualified by additional details in the remaining texts.

Thus, based solely on the provided information, no paper published in 2017 investigates the research object Architecture Design Method and has not used input data ([1], [2], [5]–[22]).

The sources below support each paper’s inclusion:

• “Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context”  
 – It is explicitly associated with architecture decision making, was published in 2018, and its Evidence 2 shows the input data is not available [1].

• “Recovering Architectural Design Decisions”  
 – This paper contributes to the area of architecture decision making, is from 2018, and its input data is indicated as not available [2].

• “Improving the Search for Architecture Knowledge in Online Developer Communities”  
 – The paper is linked to “Architecture Decision Making” and, despite one conflicting note, two sources explicitly mark its input data as not available; it was published in 2018 [4].

• “View-Centric Context Modeling to Foster the Engineering of Cyber-Physical System Networks”  
 – The texts note that while it addresses architectural aspects in software architecture and design, the input data is explicitly set to False [5].

• “Providing Context as a Service Using Service-Oriented Mobile Indie Fog and Opportunistic Computing”  
 – According to the texts, although not using the exact phrase “architecture decision making,” the work is in the field and is presented with Evidence 2 showing that the input data is not available; it was published in 2018 [6].

• “Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events: A Qualitative Multi-method Study”  
 – This study explicitly investigates architecture decision making and the available evidence confirms that its input data is not available; it is also from 2018 [7].

• “Formally Describing Self-organizing Architectures for Systems-of-Systems on the Internet-of-Things”  
 – The paper is shown to address architectural issues (via its association with an Architecture Description Language) and is associated with input data set as not available; it was published in 2018 [10].

• “Applying Architecture-Based Adaptation to Automate the Management of Internet-of-Things”  
 – This paper is in the realm of software architecture (including decision making) and its evidence indicates that input data is not available; also published in 2018 [11].

• “ECo-IoT: An Architectural Approach for Realizing Emergent Configurations in the Internet of Things”  
 – The provided texts associate this paper with architectural ideas (via an Architecture Description) and note that its input data is not available; it is from 2018 [12].

• “Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision-Making in an Agile Context”  
 – It is explicitly noted as investigating architecture decision making, published in 2018, with evidence showing the input data is not available [14].

• “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Experimentation Platform”  
 – Although the paper does not use the exact term “architecture decision making,” its associations with Software Architecture and Design and Architecture Description suggest an architectural focus; its Evidence 2 marks input data as not available and it is from 2018 [15].

• “Enabling Continuous Software Engineering for Embedded Systems Architectures with Virtual Prototypes”  
 – This work is related to architecture design (and by extension decision making) and—based on the later texts—its input data is described as not available; in addition, it was published in 2018 [22].

Each of these papers meets the dual conditions (investigation of architecture decision making or closely related architectural concerns plus input data not being available) for the year 2018 as indicated by the associated texts.

On one side, two partial answers ([3] and [5]) indicate that there was a paper published in 2017 that used the Focus Group evaluation method and did not use input data. One text ([3]) refers to “On Cognitive Biases in Architecture Decision Making” as being published in 2017 with a Focus Group evaluation and with input data characterized as not used, while another ([5]) names “Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study” as having a Focus Group evaluation (in its First Research Object 2 contribution) with evidence that input data was not actually used.

In contrast, several other partial answers ([1], [2], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], and [11]) state that no paper meeting all three conditions—a Focus Group evaluation, not using input data, and being published in 2017—has been identified.

Thus, while there are two texts that suggest candidates from 2017, a majority of the provided answers conclude that no such paper exists. Without further clarification, one cannot definitively confirm the existence of a paper published in 2017 that employed a Focus Group evaluation method and did not use input data.

These papers are:

• ""Enabling Continuous Software Engineering for Embedded Systems Architectures with Virtual Prototypes"" [1]  
• ""Data‑Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" [2]  
• ""A DSL for MAPE Patterns Representation in Self-adapting Systems"" [3]  
• ""A Generic and Highly Scalable Framework for the Automation and Execution of Scientific Data Processing and Simulation Workflows"" [5]

Each of these papers was published in 2018 and used an evaluation method where a motivating example (or case study, interpreted as such) was applied. In all four cases, the accompanying evidence (typically from Evidence 2) shows—with some minor contradictory notes in isolated passages—that input data was not used.

For example, partial answers [1], [2], and [3] each indicate that several papers published in 2019 that applied an evaluation approach—including one explicitly noting Grounded Theory—are associated with Paper Class 2. Similarly, partial answers [5], [6], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [15], and [17] confirm that the 2019 contributions belong to Paper Class 2, while noting that none of the texts consistently state that Grounded Theory was applied for evaluation in that year. 

Thus, based solely on the explicit information provided, the most frequent paper class of publications that applied an evaluation approach (including instances where Grounded Theory is mentioned, albeit not always explicitly for 2019) is Paper Class 2.

A large number of sources ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [17]) state that none of the papers published between 2019 and 2021 were evaluated using the method Argumentation. In contrast, two sources report an instance using Argumentation in 2019 ([4] and [7]), while one source claims that a paper evaluated via Argumentation was published in 2020 ([16]). 

Thus, depending on which texts one considers:
• According to [4] and [7], there is one paper from 2019 using Argumentation and none in 2020 or 2021.
• According to [16], a paper using Argumentation was published in 2020.
• According to the majority of other texts, there is no paper using Argumentation in any of these years.

In summary, the available evidence is conflicting. Most sources indicate that there are no papers using Argumentation between 2019 and 2021, whereas a few sources suggest there might be either one in 2019 or one in 2020.
