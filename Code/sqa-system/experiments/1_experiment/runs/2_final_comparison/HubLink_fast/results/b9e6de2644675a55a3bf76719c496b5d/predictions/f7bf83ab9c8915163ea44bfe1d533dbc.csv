• FLRA: A Reference Architecture for Federated Learning Systems is described as Research Level 2 but explicitly stated not to be secondary research [1].  
• “Empowering SysML-Based Software Architecture Description with Formal Verification: From SysADL to CSP” is identified as Research Level 2 with secondary research designated as False [2].  
• ""Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly"" is identified as Research Level 2, with multiple texts confirming it as primary research—not secondary research [3].  
• ""Self-Commissioning Industrial IoT-Systems in Process Automation: A Reference Architecture"" is again classified at Research Level 2 with confirmation that it is primary research [4].  
• ""ECo-IoT: An Architectural Approach for Realizing Emergent Configurations in the Internet of Things"" is similarly described as Research Level 2 that is not considered secondary research [5].  
• ""View-Centric Context Modeling to Foster the Engineering of Cyber-Physical System Networks"" is also consistently identified as Research Level 2 and primary research [6].  
• Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis is likewise associated with Research Level 2 and is specified as primary research [7].  
• For “Testing the Implementation of Concurrent AUTOSAR Drivers Against Architecture Decisions,” the texts contain conflicting statements, but both contexts associate Research Level 2 with primary research despite one mentioning secondary research as False [8].  
• ""Preventing Erosion in Exception Handling Design Using Static-Architecture Conformance Checking"" is also described in terms of Research Level 2 and confirmed as primary research [9].  
• Finally, ""Flaws in Flows: Unveiling Design Flaws via Information Flow Analysis"" is consistently presented as a Research Level 2 paper. Although one context suggests that Research Level 2 is marked as secondary research False and another confirms it as primary research, both discussions indicate that the research is not classified as secondary research [10].

Thus, across all contributions these texts show that none of the papers are designated as research level secondary research.

• 2018: One paper is clearly identified as being published in 2018 by Mohamed Soliman and classified as Paper Class 2 ([3]). Additionally, another paper published in 2018 is mentioned in [5]. Although [5] does not explicitly confirm Mohamed Soliman’s authorship, if one assumes it is his work then it would also count as a Paper Class 2 contribution in 2018.

• 2019: One paper is noted as being published in 2019 by Mohamed Soliman, classified as Paper Class 2 ([4]).

• 2021: Two papers are mentioned for 2021, both attributed to Mohamed Soliman and both clearly categorized as Paper Class 2 ([1] and [2]).

Thus, if we count only those papers with explicit authorship by Mohamed Soliman, his publication record (from the provided texts) consists of one paper in 2018, one in 2019, and two in 2021—all within Paper Class 2. If the paper mentioned in [5] is also considered his, then that adds another instance in 2018, increasing the 2018 count to two.

• One part of the provided texts indicates that the evaluation method employed is “Technical Experiment” [1], [2], [4]. This method was discussed in the context of an evaluation that used an Evaluation Method List to select a corresponding entity and was associated with various evaluation aspects such as properties named “Functional Suitability,” “Accuracy,” “Quality of Method,” among others.

• Other parts of the provided texts explicitly state “Grounded Theory” as the evaluation method used [3], [5]. In addition to naming “Grounded Theory,” those texts also mentioned evaluation properties like “Accuracy” and “Quality of Method.”

Thus, while the question refers to “Continuous Analysis of Collaborative Design,” in the provided context the explicit evaluation methods mentioned are “Technical Experiment” and “Grounded Theory” [1][2][3][4][5].

For example, one text indicates that methods such as Argumentation and Motivating Example were used within an evaluation method list [1]. Other sources report that a Case Study was employed as the evaluation method [2,3,5,6]. In addition, an Interview was explicitly mentioned as part of the evaluation [4,8]. Furthermore, there are texts that indicate the use of a Technical Experiment [7,9], while another source specifies that a Field Experiment was used to assess aspects like Effectiveness and Quality in Use [10]. One text also notes that in one evaluation instance no applicable method was assigned [9].

Thus, the evaluation methods explicitly mentioned are:  
• Argumentation  
• Motivating Example  
• Case Study  
• Interview  
• Technical Experiment  
• Focus Group (as part of a multiple-method approach)  
• Questionnaire (as part of a multiple-method approach)  
• Field Experiment

Each of these evaluation methods is supported by the provided texts [1]–[10].

One source [1] states that the status of these aspects is as follows:
• Confirmability – False  
• Internal Validity – False  
• External Validity – True  
• Repeatability – False  
• Construct Validity – True

Another source [2] presents a slightly different evaluation:
• Confirmability – False  
• Construct Validity – False  
• Internal Validity – True  
• Repeatability – False  
• External Validity – True

Additionally, [2] also mentions that the Validity 2 contribution does not reference the Threats to Validity Guideline.

Thus, while both sources agree on the identification of the five validity threats (confirmability, construct validity, internal validity, repeatability, and external validity) and on the values for confirmability, repeatability, and external validity, they differ in their assessments of internal and construct validity.

• Partial answer [1] lists four validity aspects—construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and repeatability—with a reverse alphabetical ordering of:  
 repeatability, internal validity, external validity, construct validity.

• In contrast, partial answers [2], [3], [4], and [5] present five validity threat aspects. These sources include, in addition to those above, confirmability. When these five aspects are ranked in reverse alphabetical order they all agree on the following ordering:  
 repeatability, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, confirmability.

Thus, while one source ([1]) refers to only four aspects, the remaining partial answers ([2], [3], [4], [5]) indicate that the paper’s validity threats are: confirmability, construct validity, internal validity, repeatability, and external validity. When ordered in reverse alphabetical order based on these five aspects the final ranking is:  
 repeatability, internal validity, external validity, construct validity, confirmability.

• In 2019, António Silva contributed to a paper that investigated 1 research object ([2], [8]).  
• In 2020, there are at least two papers where António Silva is mentioned as an author and each investigated 1 research object ([1], [3]).  

Thus, for the publication years where his involvement is clearly stated:  
– In 2019, António Silva investigated 1 research object.  
– In 2020, António Silva investigated 1 research object per publication (with two publications mentioned).  

For other years mentioned in the texts (2017, 2018, and 2021), there is either no explicit link to António Silva or the texts do not clearly attribute the research object investigation to him.

• In 2017 there are three separate papers by Klym Shumaiev ([2], [4], [5]). Each of these 2017 publications investigates one research object (namely, “First Research Object 2”), resulting in three research objects being investigated that year.

• In 2018 there are also three papers ([1], [3], [6]), and each paper investigates one research object (again “First Research Object 2”). This means that in 2018 a total of three research objects have been investigated.

• In 2019 two papers are reported. One paper ([7]) investigates two research objects (namely “First Research Object 2” and “Second Research Object 2”), and another paper ([10]) investigates the research object “First Research Object 2” (plus an additional investigated entity noted as “Evidence 2”). Thus, for 2019 the publications include investigations of either two or, in the case of [10], two items—with the “Evidence 2” being treated alongside the research object. Overall, this suggests that in 2019 there are four investigated items (two from [7] and two from [10]).

• In 2021 two papers are mentioned. One ([8]) investigates one research object (“First Research Object 2”), while the other ([9]) investigates two research objects (“First Research Object 2” and “Second Research Object 2”). Therefore, in 2021 a total of three research objects have been investigated.

In summary, based on the provided texts, the distribution of research objects investigated in papers by Klym Shumaiev per year is as follows:

 – 2017: 3 objects  
 – 2018: 3 objects  
 – 2019: 4 objects (counting both the two research objects from [7] and the two items from [10])  
 – 2021: 3 objects

Each of the above points cites the corresponding partial answers ([1]–[10]) as provided.

• In 2020, Mauro Caporuscio was an author on two papers. The first paper (“Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization”) employed one evaluation method—a case study [1]. The second paper (“Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly”) applied one evaluation method—a technical experiment [4]. Together, these papers account for a total of two evaluation methods in 2020.

• In 2021, Mauro Caporuscio co-authored “A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures,” which used one evaluation method—the technical experiment [2].

No additional evaluation methods linked to Mauro Caporuscio in any other publication years are mentioned in the provided texts [3] [5].

• 2017 – One paper (“Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study”) explicitly applied three evaluation approaches (Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview) [3]. (Note: While another text [6] mentions a 2017 paper with one “Technical Experiment,” that paper was not clearly linked to Danny Weyns, so the count of three from [3] is taken as the explicit evidence.)  

• 2018 – A paper (“Applying Architecture-Based Adaptation to Automate the Management of Internet-of-Things”) lists a single evaluation approach (Case Study) [1].  

• 2019 – Two Danny Weyns–authored papers are mentioned. One paper (“Continuous Adaptation Management in Collective Intelligence Systems”) used one evaluation approach (Case Study) [2], whereas another paper applied two evaluation approaches (Focus Group and Questionnaire) [4].  

• 2020 – In the paper “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions,” two evaluation approaches have been applied (Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment) [5].  

• 2021 – There is evidence (assuming the paper is by Danny Weyns) of one paper applying two evaluation approaches (Focus Group and Interview) [7] and another paper applying two evaluation approaches (each linked to a different contribution using “Motivating Example”) [8]. (If both publications are considered, each provides two applied evaluation approaches.)

• “Abstraction Layered Architecture: Writing Maintainable Embedded Code” – The publication evaluates a reference architecture (through evaluation of its First Research Object 2 which includes Functional Suitability) and contributes Evidence 2 that uses input data (with indications that input data is available) [3].

• “FLRA: A Reference Architecture for Federated Learning Systems” – This publication has been evaluated with regard to Functional Suitability (through First Research Object 2) and it includes a contribution (Evidence 2) that uses input data. Despite some conflicting details regarding the availability status, there is an explicit note that the input data is available [4].

• “Architecture-Centric Support for Integrating Security Tools in a Security Orchestration Platform” – Here, the reference architecture is evaluated for Functional Suitability (via First Research Object 2) and Evidence 2 is provided with input data that is stated to be available (again, despite some conflicting details) [6].

In particular, one paper is mentioned in [1] (""Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision-Making in an Agile Context""), a different paper appears in [2] (""A Decision Model for Choosing Patterns in Blockchain-Based Applications""), and a further paper is reported in [10] (""System- and Software-level Architecting Harmonization Practices for Systems-of-Systems: An exploratory case study on a long-running large-scale scientific instrument""). The other sources indicate that for the remaining papers discussing repeatability, the evaluation method does not include interviews. 

Thus, the final answer is: three papers [1], [2], [10].

Based on the information provided in the partial answers, there is no clear answer to the question. None of the texts mention an evaluation method specifically named ""Data Science""—with one source referring instead to ""Technical Experiment"" [1] and another to ""Case Study"" [2]. Furthermore, for the paper that discusses input data, conflicting evidence is provided regarding whether input data was used (or made available) or not. As a result, it is not possible to determine a clear count comparing the papers that have not used input data with those that have made their input data available within the context of applying an evaluation method named ""Data Science"" [1, 2].

Several sources show conflicting information about the public availability of its input data. One source (see [2]) clearly indicates that the publication’s input data is not publicly available, and another source (see [7]) also reports that the input data is explicitly marked as not available. Meanwhile, other texts about different publications (see [3], [4], [5], [6]) similarly describe the situation as inconsistent—one instance claiming that the input data is publicly available and other instances claiming it is not. However, if we follow the clear indications from [2] and [7], the net result is that among the papers using Grounded Theory for evaluation, there are:

• 0 papers with publicly available input data  
• 1 paper with input data that is not publicly available

Thus, the final answer is: among such publications, the only identified paper is reported as having input data that is not publicly available.

Only one source ([4]) diverges from this pattern by reporting that the paper “Reducing Development Overheads with a Generic and Model‑Centric Architecture for Online Games” included evaluations for both Portability and Usability.

In summary, in most cases one paper evaluated Usability while none evaluated Portability, with the single exception of the paper noted in [4] where both properties were evaluated.

• One analysis ([7]) indicates that among the papers investigating the reference architecture there are two evaluations that focus on usability and one evaluation that focuses on portability.  
• Other contributions mention instances where a paper’s evaluation focuses on usability without any corresponding mention of portability ([2], [3], [6], [8], [9]), as well as cases where one paper focuses solely on portability without mentioning usability ([5], [10]).  
• One instance ([4]) shows a single paper evaluating both properties (one focus on usability and one on portability).

Thus, overall the synthesized conclusion is that in the group of papers investigating a reference architecture there tend to be more instances focusing on usability (with counts such as one or two instances) compared to portability (typically one instance or none). The most comprehensive evidence ([7]) explicitly contrasts two instances focusing on usability versus one instance on portability.

In summary, it appears that among these papers there are two usability-focused instances versus one portability-focused instance.

Each paper listed below investigates the research object “Architecture Optimization Method” and—at least in one of their documented contributions—includes evidence where the input data is explicitly noted as not being used (for example, indicated as “None,” “False,” or “not available”). (Note that in many cases, some descriptions in the papers are conflicting, but the statements highlighted below provide clear evidence of no input data usage.)

• According to [1], “An Architecture‐Driven Adaptation Approach for Big Data Cyber Security Analytics” addresses Architecture Optimization Method and, in one description, its Evidence 2 explicitly indicates that input data is “None”/False.

• In [2], “A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures” investigates Architecture Optimization Method and contains evidence (in contexts 3 and 6) where the input data is marked as false.

• [3] reports that “Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns” investigates Architecture Optimization Method, and in Evidence 2, some descriptions indicate that the input data was not used (marked as False).

• As noted in [4], “Employment of Optimal Approximations on Apache Hadoop Checkpoint Technique for Performance Improvements” also investigates Architecture Optimization Method and includes evidence wherein the input data is designated as False or not available.

• The work described in [5] (“Dynamic Updates of Virtual PLCs Deployed as Kubernetes Microservices”) is associated with Architecture Optimization Method and explicitly notes (in one contribution’s text) that no input data was used.

• In [6], “ACE: Easy Deployment of Field Optimization Experiments” is linked to Architecture Optimization Method and in one instance (Text 6) reports that no input data was available.

• Similarly, [7] shows that “IAS: An IoT Architectural Self-adaptation Framework” investigates Architecture Optimization Method and includes two separate statements in its Evidence 2 where input data is either marked as False or reported as not available.

• The paper detailed in [8], “Applying Architecture‐Based Adaptation to Automate the Management of Internet‐of‐Things,” investigates Architecture Optimization Method, and several texts (texts 3 and 5) indicate that no input data was used.

• [9] describes “Workload-Based Clustering of Coherent Feature Sets in Microservice Architectures” as investigating Architecture Optimization Method, with parts of its evidence (texts 3 and 4) showing the input data indication as False or not available.

• Finally, [10] presents “Quantitative Verification-Aided Machine Learning: A Tandem Approach for Architecting Self-Adaptive IoT Systems” as a work on Architecture Optimization Method that includes descriptions (in texts 3 and 4) where it is stated that input data is not available (or is marked as False).

In summary, the papers that investigate the research object “Architecture Optimization Method” and include explicit evidence stating that no input data was used (despite some conflicting statements elsewhere) are reported in sources [1] through [10].

• According to [2], the paper “On Interfaces to Support Agile Architecting in Automotive: An Exploratory Case Study” is described as employing input data in its contribution; however, some explicit descriptions note that the input data is “not used” (or “not available”), thereby indicating that—at least in those instances—the paper does not actually use input data.

• In [4], the paper “EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring” shows conflicting information. One context marks the use of input data as True, but two explicit statements report that the input data is not used (or not available). Consequently, under those representations, its contribution does not use input data.

• The paper “Improving the Consistency and Usefulness of Architecture Descriptions: Guidelines for Architects” as presented in [7] has at least one explicit description stating that although input data is mentioned in the contribution, it is not used. This makes it a clear candidate for a paper that—in the reported evidence—does not use input data.

• Finally, in [9] the paper “Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context” is the only paper discussed in that set of texts, and while one source indicates that input data is used, two other sources explicitly note that input data is either not used or not available. Hence, under those instances the paper’s contribution does not use input data (though the information is conflicting overall).

All the other papers mentioned in the texts either consistently indicate that input data is used or only provide conflicting details without a clear indication of non-use. 

In summary, based on the provided evidence:
• “On Interfaces to Support Agile Architecting in Automotive: An Exploratory Case Study” ([2]),
• “EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring” ([4]),
• “Improving the Consistency and Usefulness of Architecture Descriptions: Guidelines for Architects” ([7]), and
• “Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context” ([9])

have at least one instance in which their contribution (Evidence 2) is explicitly indicated as not using input data.

1. ""Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study"" uses the Questionnaire evaluation method and explicitly shows that input data was not used [1].

2. ""How Software Architects Focus Their Attention"" is reported as using Questionnaire and includes explicit information indicating that no input data was used in at least one account—even though one text noted otherwise [2].

3. ""Migrating Towards Microservice Architectures: An Industrial Survey"" is described with a contribution evaluated via Questionnaire, and the evidence flagged that input data was not used [3].

4. ""An Exploratory Study of Naturalistic Decision Making in Complex Software Architecture Environments"" employs Questionnaire (via its first research object) and clearly indicates through its evidence that no input data was used [4].

5. ""Identifying and Prioritizing Architectural Debt Through Architectural Smells: A Case Study in a Large Software Company"" was evaluated by Questionnaire and the evidence contributions show that no input data was used [5].

6. ""A Survey on Big Data Analytics Solutions Deployment"" is shown to have used Questionnaire and—despite one conflicting passage—there is explicit evidence (in some texts) that input data was marked as not used (False) [6].

7. ""Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems"" used Questionnaire (via its First Research Object 2) and no input data was indicated as used for that evaluation [7].

8. ""Continuous Analysis of Collaborative Design"" is described as using Questionnaire and its evidence clearly indicates that input data was not used (value set to False) [8].

9. ""Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis"" employs Questionnaire and, despite one reference to input data used, there is an explicit indication (through Evidence 2) that input data was not used (available attribute set to False) [9].

10. ""Improving the Consistency and Usefulness of Architecture Descriptions: Guidelines for Architects"" uses Questionnaire and also shows through its evidence that input data was not used [10].

Each of the above papers is documented as employing the Questionnaire method while also including evaluations that indicate input data was not used.

• “REST vs GraphQL: A Controlled Experiment” applies a controlled experiment and is explicitly associated with “Input Data available: False” ([1]).  
• “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions” was evaluated with a controlled experiment, and there is no indication that any input data are available ([2]).  
• “Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games” employs a controlled experiment and the evidence indicates that the related input data is not available ([3]).  
• “On the Understandability of Semantic Constraints for Behavioral Software Architecture Compliance: A Controlled Experiment” uses a controlled experiment, and despite one conflicting mention, the explicit input data details indicate it is not available ([4]).  
• “Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared” applies a controlled experiment and the input data is clearly marked as not available ([6]).  
• “ACE: Easy Deployment of Field Optimization Experiments” (as contributed to First Research Object 2, evaluated via what is interpreted as a controlled “Field Experiment”) also has explicit markings that its input data is not available ([8]).  

Each of these papers meets the criteria: they employ a controlled experiment and the provided evidence confirms that input data is not available.

For example, one paper explicitly dealing with this topic was published in 2017 [1]. In 2018, there are two papers mentioned—one “Empirical Study of Architectural Decay in Open-Source Software” and another “Predicting the Performance of Privacy-Preserving Data Analytics Using Architecture Modelling and Simulation” [3, 4]. Similarly, one paper from 2019 is noted in the context of architectural security weaknesses [2], and one paper in 2020 is associated with enforcing architectural security decisions [6]. 

It is important to note that while these individual years indicate the publication of one or more papers on the topic, the texts do not provide enough information to establish a broader yearly trend or a typical frequency rate.

• Motivating Example – Also explicitly listed as an evaluation method in one of the evaluations [4].

• Case Study – This method is explicitly indicated in texts that discuss evaluations for specific research objects (e.g., those evaluating software quality properties) [5] and [9].

• Controlled Experiment – This method is explicitly mentioned in connection with a Technical Experiment in one of the evaluations [7].

• Focus Group and Questionnaire – These evaluation methods are used in the evaluation of architectural assumptions in one instance [8].

Additionally, one text [10] notes that in another evaluation, the evaluation method was explicitly reported as false, which implies that no standard method was applied in that particular case.

Thus, the evaluations of compatibility have employed a range of methods—including but not limited to Technical Experiment, Interview, Field Experiment, Controlled Experiment, Argumentation, Motivating Example, Case Study, Focus Group, and Questionnaire—with each paper selecting its specific approach or combination thereof as reflected in its Evaluation Method List (see, for example, [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10]).

• Source [1] reports three evaluation methods—Technical Experiment, Questionnaire, and Controlled Experiment.  
• Sources [2] and [6] indicate that only one evaluation method is applied for evaluating reliability, namely, Technical Experiment.  
• Source [3] names three approaches—Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview.  
• Source [4] mentions two methods—Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment.  
• Source [5] describes a single evaluation method based on the Case Study approach.  
• Source [7] specifies two methods, Motivating Example and Technical Experiment, although it is not clear if both are used solely for reliability.  
• Source [8] mentions two methods—Technical Experiment and Argumentation.  
• Source [9] outlines three evaluation methods—Argumentation, Technical Experiment, and Motivating Example—even though it notes the methods are not explicitly linked only to reliability.  
• Source [10] provides two methods—Interview and Field Experiment—even though they are used in an evaluation that includes reliability, not necessarily as isolated measures for reliability.

Thus, depending on the text referenced, the answer ranges from one to three evaluation methods being applied.

Although some texts associate the evaluation with research objects such as Architecture Decision Making or refer to specific studies, the explicit evaluation instances indicate that “Satisfaction” is evaluated one time and “Context coverage” is also evaluated one time (see [2], [4], [5], [6], [8], and [10]). While a couple of texts mention instances with differing frequencies, these are not linked to investigations of Architecture Evolution. Overall, with respect to the research object in question, the paper evaluates both properties exactly once ([1], [3], [7], and [9]).

One source mentions that, overall, Maintainability is evaluated once and Usability twice, but it does not specify that the Case Study method applies to Usability [2]. Thus, while the Case Study method is explicitly linked to an evaluation of Maintainability, there is no corresponding information for Usability.

• In one instance [4], both usability and maintainability are explicitly evaluated—with usability assessed once and maintainability once.

• In another detailed instance [10] (specifically for the controlled experiment on First Research Object 2), both properties are again evaluated once. Although another usability evaluation is mentioned for a different research object, it is not linked to the controlled experiment method.

Thus, in the publications that clearly apply a controlled experiment in their evaluation, usability and maintainability are each evaluated one time, meaning they are evaluated equally often [4][10].

In one study, the evaluated properties include Maintainability and Product Quality [1]. In another study focusing on a related research object, the evaluation considered Accuracy and Quality of Method without following a guideline [2]. Additionally, there are accounts that, in similar contexts, the evaluations also mention Functional Suitability alongside Maintainability and Product Quality [4]. Furthermore, one evaluation conducted without a guideline further identifies Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, and Product Quality as the properties of interest [5]. Thus, the aggregated properties evaluated in papers investigating Technical Debt without adhering to an evaluation guideline are:

• Maintainability  
• Product Quality  
• Accuracy  
• Quality of Method  
• Functional Suitability  
• Quality in Use

Each of these properties appears in different studies as described in sources [1], [2], [4], and [5].

Finally, one publication summarized the set of properties without a guideline as including Performance efficiency, Product Quality, Accuracy, Quality of Method, and an evaluation relating to Threats to Validity [9]. In contrast, another study reported that all the properties in its evaluation were carried out with a guideline [7] or did not specify a particular property for the evaluation without a guideline [10].

Thus, among publications investigating architectural assumptions, the properties evaluated without following a guideline were:
 – Functional Suitability  
 – Product Quality  
 – Performance efficiency  
 – Quality in Use  
 – Quality of Method  
 – Effectiveness  
 – Accuracy  
 – Satisfaction  
 – Recovery  
 – (and an evaluation relating to Threats to Validity)

These properties, drawn from the evaluations described in the literature, illustrate the diversity of aspects assessed without the support of an evaluation guideline [1][2][3][4][6][8][9].

On the one hand, sources [1] and [2] both indicate that First Research Object 2 is evaluated using the Field Experiment method and is done so without an evaluation guideline. On the other hand, source [3] contradicts this by stating that despite being evaluated via Field Experiment, First Research Object 2 actually has a guideline (marked as True), implying that no research object meets the criteria of being evaluated with Field Experiment and without a guideline.

Thus, according to [1] and [2] the research object is First Research Object 2, while [3] contends that no such research object exists.

In some publications, the evaluation of First Research Object 2 (see [1], [2], [3], [8], and [9]) is noted as not using a guideline, while in other publications, the evaluation of Second Research Object 2 is described as occurring without the use of a guideline (see [2], [4], [5], [6], and [7]). Thus, among the publications that apply grounded theory in their evaluation, the research objects evaluated without using a guideline are:

 • First Research Object 2  
 • Second Research Object 2

It is important to note that the details provided vary by publication, but these two research objects are the ones identified as having been evaluated under conditions where no guideline was used.

Although Grounded Theory is also mentioned in contexts [2] and [4], the explicit conclusion in [3] identifies Data Science as the evaluation method applied the most in these papers [1], [3].

For example, one set of texts explicitly highlights Maintainability and Product Quality as key properties [1], while another confirms that the evaluation investigates Maintainability, Product Quality, and Functional Suitability [3]. Additional references also mention Functional Suitability together with Product Quality [4, 6, 10]. 

Some other sources mention different properties (such as Accuracy, Quality of Method, Effectiveness, Quality in Use, Performance Efficiency, or Context Coverage), but these appear less consistently in connection with Technical Debt. Thus, based solely on the provided texts, the properties most often investigated for Technical Debt are Maintainability, Product Quality, and Functional Suitability.

Several sources indicate that Quality in Use, Product Quality, Quality of Method, and Accuracy appear frequently across different evaluations ([6], [8], [9]). In addition, properties such as Performance efficiency and Satisfaction have also been commonly assessed ([7], [1], [5]), while other properties like Effectiveness and Functional Suitability have appeared as well ([1], [6]). One source even mentions an evaluation of Context coverage ([2]), though this property is less frequently referenced overall.

In summary, among the properties evaluated most often are Quality in Use, Product Quality, Quality of Method, and Accuracy, with Performance efficiency, Satisfaction, Effectiveness, and Functional Suitability also being significant in the evaluations ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]).

Although other evaluations mention properties such as “Product Quality” and “Quality in Use,” for this specific investigation the explicit detail is that “Functional Suitability” is the property evaluated [1,9].

Three sources state that the evaluation method is “Case Study” [3,5,7], while three other sources indicate that a “Technical Experiment” was used [2,4,8]. One text [1] only mentions that the evaluation involved an assessment of Functional Suitability without specifying an approach with explicit guidelines, and text [6] provides evaluation details related to a different reference architecture. 

Thus, based solely on the explicit conclusions, some texts (namely [3,5,7]) clearly conclude that the evaluation method applied is a Case Study, while others ([2,4,8]) mention a Technical Experiment.

For instance, one paper evaluated the research object using a Questionnaire [1]. In other work, Grounded Theory was explicitly applied; this method appears in multiple instances [2, 8, 9]. A Focus Group was also used in the evaluation process in another paper [3]. In addition, an evaluation method referred to as Data Science was employed for assessing the research object in one contribution [4]. Additionally, some studies utilized Interview as an evaluation method [5, 10], while another work applied Argumentation as the evaluation approach [6].

For instance, in some papers the accuracy property was evaluated using a Technical Experiment approach. One paper explicitly described an evaluation where the investigated objects were assessed through a Technical Experiment that included a property defined with the sub‐property “Accuracy” ([2], [6]). In other studies, a Case Study method was applied as part of a broader Evaluation Method List where one of the evaluation properties was explicitly labeled “Accuracy” ([3], [4], [8]). Additionally, in one instance the overall evaluation process incorporated both a Technical Experiment and Argumentation—with Accuracy being one of the properties evaluated within that process—even though no evaluation method was described as being used solely for accuracy ([9]).  

Other evaluation methods mentioned in Duc Le’s work (such as Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview [1] or Data Science [5], [7]) were part of the overall evaluation process; however, there is no explicit statement linking these methods directly to the evaluation of accuracy.

In summary, the explicit methods applied to evaluate accuracy on the investigated objects were the Technical Experiment and the Case Study approaches—with one instance combining Technical Experiment with Argumentation—while other methods were used for different evaluation properties.

For example, one paper clearly describes using a Controlled Experiment to assess usability – where a property (with a sub‐property explicitly named “Usability”) was examined [1,7]. In another case, the evaluation of a research object incorporated an Interview method as its declared evaluation technique while still focusing on usability as one of several properties [2]. Several other papers report the use of a Technical Experiment method to evaluate usability; here the evaluation framework assessed multiple properties (including usability) via this method [3,5,6,10]. Finally, one of the papers (Butterfly Space) applied a Case Study approach within an overall evaluation framework that captured usability-related aspects by measuring properties like “Quality in Use” along with others [9]. 

In summary, the methods applied to evaluate usability in the papers by Lu Xiao include Controlled Experiments, Interviews, Technical Experiments, and a Case Study approach, with usability consistently being assessed as a defined property within broader evaluation frameworks.

Some texts state that the evaluation was conducted using a Case Study method ([1], [2], [5], [9]), while others indicate that a Technical Experiment was applied ([3], [4], [6], [8], [10]). In addition, one text mentions the use of Grounded Theory as an evaluation method for a related research object ([7]). Furthermore, the evaluation processes were supported by the assessment of various evaluation properties such as Accuracy, Quality of Method, Functional Suitability, Product Quality, and Performance Efficiency, with some texts also noting specific guideline attributes. 

Thus, based on the provided sources, the evaluation methods applied with the Architecture Analysis Method include either a Case Study or a Technical Experiment, with one source also pointing to Grounded Theory as an evaluation variant.

Some sources indicate that only one evaluation method was applied in the papers evaluating efficiency [1, 4, 6, 8, 9]—for example, one text explicitly mentions “Technical Experiment” while another mentions “Case Study.” In contrast, other sources state that two evaluation methods were used [2, 3, 7] (for instance, one source indicates both “Technical Experiment” and “Controlled Experiment”) and one source even lists three methods [5]. 

Thus, according to the supplied partial answers there is no single agreed‐upon number; different texts report that David Monschein applied either one, two, or three different evaluation methods in papers that evaluate the property Efficiency.

Thus, while several sources point to a single evaluation method being explicitly linked to property Satisfaction, other sources provide evidence for two or even three evaluation methods applied overall.

For example, some sources state that two evaluation methods were used. One version ([1]) identifies these as a Questionnaire and a Case Study, while other texts ([5], [9], [10]) mention pairs such as Technical Experiment with Argumentation or Motivating Example paired with Technical Experiment.

On the other hand, several texts ([2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8]) refer to only one method being used—for instance, Grounded Theory, Case Study, or Motivating Example.

Thus, depending on the interpretation of the texts, the answer is not unequivocal. Some sources indicate that two distinct evaluation methods have been applied by Stefan Kugele to evaluate architecture patterns ([1], [5], [9], [10]), whereas other accounts suggest that only one evaluation method was employed ([2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8]).

For example, one set of texts identifies the evaluation methods as Focus Group and Interview ([1]), another as Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment ([2]), yet another as Focus Group and Questionnaire ([6]), and a further text presents Technical Experiment and Argumentation ([8]). Although some texts report only one method (see [3], [4], [5], and [7]), the majority of the contributions explicitly cite two evaluation methods. Therefore, the final answer is that two evaluation methods have been applied by Ingo Weber in the research on Architecture Decision Making.

• Functional Suitability (evident in [1], [2], and [3])  
• Product Quality (noted in [1], [2], [3], [5], [7], [8], and [9])  
• Quality of Method (mentioned in [4], [6], and [10])  
• Accuracy (mentioned in [4], [6], and [10])  
• Compatibility (mentioned in [5])  
• Performance efficiency (mentioned in [7] and [8])  
• Quality in Use (mentioned in [10])  
• Effectiveness (mentioned in [10])

When these are arranged in descending alphabetical order based solely on their names, the ranking is:

1. Quality of Method  
2. Quality in Use  
3. Product Quality  
4. Performance efficiency  
5. Functional Suitability  
6. Effectiveness  
7. Compatibility  
8. Accuracy

Each property and its ordering is directly derived from the cited texts ([1] through [10]).

Several evaluation properties were investigated by Andreas Burger using the Technical Experiment method. The properties explicitly mentioned in one or more texts are as follows:

• Accuracy ([2], [7])  
• Effectiveness ([2], [6])  
• Efficiency ([6], [7])  
• Freedom from Risk ([3])  
• Functional Suitability ([1], [5])  
• Maintainability ([3])  
• Performance efficiency ([1], [4], [5], [7])  
• Product Quality ([1], [4], [5], [7])  
• Quality in Use ([2], [6], [7])  
• Quality of Method ([2], [7])  
• Usability ([5])

When these properties are arranged in descending alphabetical order (from Z to A), the comprehensive list is:

1. Usability  
2. Quality of Method  
3. Quality in Use  
4. Product Quality  
5. Performance efficiency  
6. Maintainability  
7. Functional Suitability  
8. Freedom from Risk  
9. Efficiency  
10. Effectiveness  
11. Accuracy

This ordering and the list of properties are synthesized directly from the information provided in the texts ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]).

• According to sources [1] and [2], the research object Architecture Extraction is investigated in at least one paper published in 2018, with no corresponding evidence for a publication on the topic in 2020.  
• In contrast, source [3] indicates that a paper published in 2020 investigates Architecture Extraction, while it does not mention any such investigation in 2018.

Thus, while some texts show that Architecture Extraction was studied in a 2018 publication (and not in 2020), another text claims that it was instead investigated in a 2020 publication (with no evidence for 2018). Without additional context, the provided texts present two conflicting views on the year in which the Architecture Extraction research object was investigated.

• In 2018, there were two studies that include an investigation of architecture patterns: one study on reducing development overheads for online games [1] and another study focusing on identifying and prioritizing architectural debt through architectural smells [2].

• In 2020, one study (“Model‑Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns”) contributes an element related to an architecture pattern [3].

Thus, compared to 2020, architecture patterns were investigated in 2018 twice, while in 2020 there was a single investigation.

• According to source [1], the paper “Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis” from 2020 used an evaluation method that includes the Questionnaire. This source states that no instance of applying the Questionnaire exists for a paper published in 2021.

• In contrast, sources [2] and [3] indicate that the Questionnaire evaluation method is associated with a 2021 publication. Source [2] cites “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” as the only referenced publication, with the Questionnaire used in its evaluation, and source [3] reports that the paper “How Software Architects Focus Their Attention” from 2021 also used the Questionnaire.

Therefore, while one source ([1]) suggests that only the 2020 paper was evaluated with the Questionnaire, the other sources ([2] and [3]) indicate that the Questionnaire method was applied in publications from 2021. Based on the available partial answers, there is no single, consistent answer regarding how frequently the Questionnaire was applied in 2020 versus 2021.

On the one hand, several sources (e.g., [1], [4], [7], [8], [9], and [10]) report that every research object under investigation in Uwe Zdun’s papers is associated with some type of evaluation method. On the other hand, a subset of the texts ([2], [3], [5], and [6]) identify specific cases where no evaluation method was applied. These sources indicate the following research objects as not having any evaluation method applied:

• In one paper, a research object labeled Second Research Object 2 (associated, for example, with the “Architecture Optimization Method”) is said to have its evaluation marked as False, meaning no proper evaluation method was applied [2], [6].  
• In another paper, the research object labeled Evidence 2 is mentioned as one that employs tool support but does not have any evaluation method applied [3].  
• Additionally, a contribution described as “Paper Class 2” is noted as “not classified as evaluation research” (i.e., no evaluation method is associated with it) [5], [6].

Thus, according to parts of the provided texts, the research objects investigated by Uwe Zdun that did not have an evaluation method applied are Second Research Object 2, Evidence 2, and the contribution associated with Paper Class 2.

The methods explicitly mentioned as having their “Has Guideline” attribute set to False are as follows:

• Technical Experiment – This evaluation method is cited in multiple sources ([1], [4], [5], [8], [9]) as having been used without an associated evaluation guideline.  
• Case Study – Several texts ([2], [3], [7]) indicate that a case study approach was used for evaluation, again with no evaluation guideline applied.  
• Motivating Example and Argumentation – As described in [6] and [9], evaluations for the second research object were conducted using methods named Motivating Example (and in one source, Argumentation is also mentioned) without an evaluation guideline.

It is important to note that although another evaluation method (Grounded Theory) is reported in one text ([10]), it was applied with a guideline (the guideline setting was True) and thus does not meet the criteria of being used without an evaluation guideline.

In the paper ""Integrating Statistical Response Time Models in Architectural Performance Models"" (which lists Johannes Grohmann as one of the authors), the evaluation method applied was the Technical Experiment [1]. In another paper, “Incremental Calibration of Architectural Performance Models with Parametric Dependencies” (partially authored by Johannes Grohmann), the evaluation was conducted using the Case Study method [7]. 

Thus, in papers published by Johannes Grohmann, the evaluation methods used without adhering to a guideline are Technical Experiment and Case Study.

In some cases, only one research object is investigated without using input data, while in others, two are examined:

• In one publication (e.g., “QoS‐Based Formation of Software Architectures in the Internet of Things”), the research contribution that does not use input data is designated as First Research Object 2. This object is variously described as the Architecture Design Method or the Architecture Analysis Method (see [1] and [3]). Other texts also confirm that only the contribution labeled Evidence 2 uses input data, leaving First Research Object 2 as the one investigated free of input data (see [1], [4], and [5]).  

• In another publication (e.g., “Model-based Performance Analysis for Architecting Cyber-Physical Dynamic Spaces”), two research objects are investigated that do not rely on input data. These are:  
 – First Research Object 2, identified as “Architecture Analysis Method”  
 – Second Research Object 2, identified as “Architecture Pattern” (see [2], [6], and [7]).  

Thus, the final answer is that, in publications from Davide Arcelli, the research objects investigated that have not used input data include:  
 – First Research Object 2 (described variously as Architecture Design Method, Architecture Analysis Method, Architecture Optimization Method, or associated with an Architecture Description Language) and, in some cases,  
 – Second Research Object 2 (described as either Architecture Extraction or Architecture Pattern).  

In all cases, the contribution labeled Evidence 2 is the only one explicitly linked to input data ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]).

133,f7bf83ab9c8915163ea44bfe1d533dbc,ce07faf7-c907-424b-8c06-a01beaa2c95e,"The available texts do not provide a single, unambiguous answer across all cases, and different papers highlight different properties. For example, one set of texts indicates that for one paper the property Product Quality was mentioned for two different research objects—suggesting that Product Quality is evaluated the most (see [1]). In contrast, another paper’s evaluation lists several properties (including Quality in Use, Quality of Method, Accuracy, and others) that each appear only once, so no one property stands out (see [2] and [8]). Similarly, other texts describe evaluations that focus on properties such as Effectiveness (with one text noting it as explicitly detailed as a sub‐property [7] and another associating the Architecture Analysis Method with Effectiveness [10]), and yet another text emphasizes Accuracy as most often evaluated, again based on its detailed sub–property description (see [9]). Finally, additional evaluations mention properties such as Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, and Satisfaction, but without frequency counts that would allow one to be singled out (see [3], [4], and [5]). 

Thus, while some texts identify Product Quality, Accuracy, or Effectiveness as the most salient property in their particular evaluations, there is no overall consensus across the provided papers. Each paper appears to focus on different properties. 

In summary, the final answer is that the provided texts cannot be reconciled to show a single property as being evaluated more often than the others, with some contributions favoring Product Quality, some highlighting Accuracy, and others emphasizing Effectiveness ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10]).

Several sources indicate a range of evaluation methods. However, when considering only papers in the paper class with a proposal of solution that also investigate the research object Architecture Extraction, the explicit evidence points to one method for that research object. For example, one source ([9]) explains that in a paper that is classified as having a proposal of solution, one research object related to an architecture description (interpreted here as Architecture Extraction) was evaluated through an Evaluation Method List including an entity named “Technical Experiment.” Other texts ([2] and [6]) also mention “Technical Experiment” in association with contributions involving architecture, while additional methods (such as “Case Study,” “Benchmark,” “Motivating Example,” or “Argumentation”) appear in contexts that either do not involve both the proposal of solution and Architecture Extraction or relate to other research objects.  

Thus, the synthesis of the provided evidence is that for papers with the proposal-of-solution classification dealing with Architecture Extraction, the evaluation method that has been most explicitly applied is “Technical Experiment” ([2], [6], [9]).

Partial answer [2] indicates that a paper published in 2019 (“Architectural Security Weaknesses in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) an Empirical Study Based on Disclosed Software Vulnerabilities”) was evaluated using the Data Science method, with no instances reported for 2020 or 2021. In contrast, partial answers [4] and [5] report that a paper published in 2021 (“Architectural Decay as Predictor of Issue- and Change-Proneness”) was evaluated with Data Science and that no such evaluations occurred in 2019 or 2020. Partial answers [1], [3], and [6] add that outside 2018 there is little to no information about evaluations using Data Science for the years in question.

If we follow the synthesis that is supported by the majority of the later partial answers, then for the queried publication years the evaluation frequency is as follows:
 • 2019: 0 papers  
 • 2020: 0 papers  
 • 2021: 1 paper evaluated with the Data Science method [4], [5].

It is important to note that while one source [2] suggests an evaluation in 2019, the combined evidence from the other sources leads to the conclusion above.

In contrast, several 2019 publications evaluated compatibility using a variety of methods: one used “Case Study” [1, 8], another applied a “Technical Experiment” [2, 4], a third employed “Grounded Theory” [3, 6], another used “Focus Group” [5], and yet another applied the “Interview” method [7].

• Several texts ([1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [9]) indicate that papers such as “An Architecture-Driven Adaptation Approach for Big Data Cyber Security Analytics,” “Synthesis and Quantitative Verification of Tradeoff Spaces for Families of Software Systems,” “Experiments in Curation: Towards Machine-Assisted Construction of Software Architecture Knowledge Bases,” “Quantitative Verification-Aided Machine Learning: A Tandem Approach for Architecting Self-Adaptive IoT Systems,” “Recovering Architectural Design Decisions,” and “Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation” do apply the Technical Experiment evaluation method but do not have their paper class identified as a personal experience paper. In these texts the personal experience paper flag is explicitly said to be false.

• In contrast, partial answers [5] and [8] present a different account. According to [5], the work titled “Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures” meets both criteria (its Paper Class 2 is defined as a personal experience paper and it applied the Technical Experiment evaluation method) and was published in 2018. Similarly, [8] states that “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” is considered a personal experience paper (despite its Paper Class 2 flag being set to false in other descriptions) and applied the Technical Experiment method, with a publication year of 2020.

Thus, while the majority of the partial answers indicate that no paper meets both conditions, [5] and [8] each identify one paper that fulfills the criteria. Taking the two papers mentioned in [5] and [8] as valid, and ranking them in descending order of publication year, we obtain:

1. “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” (2020) [8]
2. “Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures” (2018) [5]

Final Answer:
Based on the partial answers that meet both conditions, the papers that have a personal experience paper as their paper class and applied the Technical Experiment evaluation method are, in descending order of publication year:
 1. “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” (2020)
 2. “Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures” (2018)

• According to [1], “Architectural Technical Debt: A Grounded Theory” (published in 2020) is classified as validation research and evaluated with Grounded Theory.  
• According to [2], “On Service-Orientation for Automotive Software” (published in 2017) is also classified as validation research and evaluated using Grounded Theory.

On the other hand, the remaining sources ([3] through [8]) consistently indicate that none of the publications described meet both criteria—that is, although several publications are evaluated using Grounded Theory, each is either not classified as validation research or is instead identified as employing evaluation research.

Thus, while [1] and [2] list two candidate publications (with [1] being the newest and [2] earlier), the other texts dispute that any publication satisfies both conditions.

• Several sources note that no paper explicitly investigating architecture decision making was mentioned for 2020 [1], [2], [3], [6], [7], [8], [9].

• In contrast, multiple sources indicate one paper from 2021 is mentioned. For example, one text explicitly identifies the work published in 2021 (""Updating Service-Based Software Systems"" or, in other partials, works with different titles) as addressing the topic, although some of the descriptions do not assert a clear investigation of architecture decision making. Nevertheless, as summed up in several partial answers [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], only one paper from 2021 is identified in this context.

Thus, the information provided shows that in 2020 there were 0 papers explicitly investigating architecture decision making and in 2021 there was 1 paper mentioned.

• In contrast, sources [2] and [4] indicate that one paper published in 2017 evaluates the property Maintainability, while no paper published in 2020 is noted for this evaluation.

Thus, depending on which source is considered, either one paper from 2020 evaluates Maintainability (with none in 2017) or one paper from 2017 evaluates Maintainability (with none in 2020).

• Sources [1] and [2] each describe a paper (or papers) from 2017 that investigate Architecture Design Method and have contributions (Evidence 2) where input data is explicitly indicated as not used (or its flag set to False).  
• Source [4] names “Design Criteria to Architect Continuous Experimentation for Self-Driving Vehicles” as the 2017 paper that investigates Architecture Design Method and later contexts indicate that input data was not used.  
• However, other sources ([3], [5], [6], [7], and [8]) provide conflicting or disqualifying information—some identifying papers that either use input data, are published in a different year, or present ambiguous evidence regarding the usage of input data.

In summary, while several texts point to a paper (or papers) from 2017 that investigate Architecture Design Method with a contribution indicating input data was not used (see [1], [2], and [4]), other texts note conflicting evidence or do not support the complete set of requirements. Therefore, based solely on the provided texts there is no unambiguously agreed paper that meets all the required conditions.

According to the provided texts, the following papers investigate architecture decision making and were published in 2018 while also reporting that their Evidence 2 contribution uses input data that is not available (i.e. “available” is False):

• [1] ""Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events: A Qualitative Multi-method Study""  
 This study is clearly in the field of architecture decision making and explicitly notes that its Evidence 2 uses input data marked as not available.

• [2] ""Recovering Architectural Design Decisions""  
 This paper is identified with the “Architecture Decision Making” research object. Although published in 2018, multiple passages (e.g. passages 3 and 5) indicate that the input data for Evidence 2 is not available.

• [3] ""Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context""  
 This work is associated with a research object named “Architecture Decision Making” and was published in 2018. It includes a direct statement (in Text 6) that for Evidence 2 the input data is not available.

• [4] ""ECo-IoT: An Architectural Approach for Realizing Emergent Configurations in the Internet of Things""  
 Although primarily presented in the domain of Software Architecture and Design, it also contributes to architectural aspects. While several texts note that input data is employed, one explicit passage indicates that the input data is not available.

• [5] ""Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision-Making in an Agile Context""  
 This paper is associated with the “Architecture Decision Making” research object and published in 2018. It explicitly states that it “utilizes input data that is not available” for its Evidence 2.

• [6] ""An Expert Recommendation System for Design Decision Making: Who Should be Involved in Making a Design Decision?""  
 This publication is connected with architecture decision making (via its research object) and is from 2018. Multiple indications (despite one conflicting statement) report that its Evidence 2 uses input data flagged as not available.

• [7] ""Enabling Continuous Software Engineering for Embedded Systems Architectures with Virtual Prototypes""  
 Published in 2018 and associated with architectural design aspects, this paper is noted as having input data for Evidence 2 that is not available.

• [8] ""The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Experimentation Platform""  
 While this paper’s focus is on Software Architecture and Design (with an “Architecture Description”), it is reported that its Evidence 2 contribution uses input data that is not available, fulfilling the criteria.

• [9] ""Improving the Search for Architecture Knowledge in Online Developer Communities""  
 This study is linked with “Architecture Decision Making” and published in 2018. Although one passage indicates that its input data is available, at least two other passages clearly report that the input data for Evidence 2 is not available.

• [10] ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures""  
 This paper contributes to the architecture domain with entities such as “Architecture Description” and “Architecture Design Method” and was published in 2018. While one passage reports a conflicting input data flag, two explicit texts note that its Evidence 2 uses input data that is not available.

Each of these papers meets the two criteria—investigating aspects related to architecture decision making (or closely related architectural fields) and reporting for their relevant Evidence 2 that input data is not available (flagged as False) even though they were published in 2018.

Some sources indicate that the only paper investigating the object architecture description was published in 2018—with [1], [2], [6], and [9] each stating that an 2018 paper (or papers) is the sole publication in this area for the period. In contrast, a different set of texts report that a paper published in 2020 is the only one addressing the object architecture description. This view is supported by [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], and [10]. In both cases, there is no mention of any papers published in 2019. 

Thus, depending on which partial answer is considered, the distribution is either one paper in 2018 or one paper in 2020, with no papers from 2019.
