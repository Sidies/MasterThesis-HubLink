- It addresses **construct validity**, focusing on identifying and analyzing threats within the context of blockchain-based micro economy platforms.
- For **internal validity**, it mentions a false threat, indicating that this particular threat is not considered relevant according to Validity 2 guidelines.
- For **external validity**, it discusses an aspect related to external validity, indicating that this threat is indeed true.

Therefore, the paper explicitly addresses threats to construct validity and both internal (false) and external (true) validity. [1][2]

1. **First Research Object 2 (Architecture Decision Making)**:
   - Evaluations involve assessing properties such as Product Quality and Functional Suitability.
   
2. **Second Research Object (Product Quality Evaluation)**:
   - Evaluations focus on product quality but do not necessarily follow strict guidelines.

Given this context, the evaluation methods for ""Modeling and predicting performance of microservices-based systems using machine learning techniques"" or similar papers would likely involve assessing properties such as Product Quality and Functional Suitability. For a paper like ""Evaluating the impact of architectural decisions on system maintainability in microservice architectures,"" it would also focus on product quality without necessarily adhering to strict guidelines.

Therefore, the evaluation methods for both research objects can be summarized as follows:

- **First Research Object 2 (Architecture Decision Making)**:
  - Evaluation Method: Assessments that include Product Quality and Functional Suitability.
  
- **Second Research Object (Product Quality Evaluation)**:
  - Evaluation Method: Focus on product quality without strict guidelines.

However, some contributions focus on aspects that might implicitly relate to recovery:

1. **Trace Link Recovery for Software Architecture Documentation**: This document focuses on recovering trace links within software architecture documentation, which implies an evaluation related to recovery.

2. Other descriptions do not mention ""Recovery"" explicitly but evaluate various properties such as Product Quality and Satisfaction in the context of exception handling design or decision models for microservices.

Given this information:

- The property named ""Recovery"" is not listed among the provided evaluations.
- However, the document titled ""Trace Link Recovery for Software Architecture Documentation"" implicitly evaluates recovery-related aspects.

Therefore, based on the given descriptions:
- **The property ""recovery"" (or similar) is not explicitly mentioned in any of the provided texts.**
- The closest match to evaluating recovery is found in the document focusing on trace link recovery within software architecture documentation.

If you need further clarification or a specific evaluation related to recovery, please provide additional context or details about the exact property or aspect you are interested in.

- **Paper Class 2 (R872046)** involves evaluations with properties such as ""Quality in Use,"" but does not explicitly mention security or safety.
- Evidence 2 uses input data for its evaluation methodology.

Therefore, while Paper Class 2 evaluates various quality attributes and uses input data, it does not specifically focus on evaluating a property named ""Security"" or ""Safety.""

**Final Answer:**
There is no explicit evaluation of the properties ""Security"" or ""Safety."" However, Paper Class 2 (R872046) involves evaluations with broader quality attributes like ""Quality in Use,"" and uses input data for its methodology.

- **Text 2:** Evidence 2 uses input data that is not available.
- **Text 3:** Evidence 2 uses input data (true).
- **Text 6:** Evidence 2 does not use any input data.

Due to these conflicting statements, it is unclear whether the input data used for assessing functional suitability is actually available or utilized in a consistent manner. Therefore:

**Evaluates Functional Suitability:** Yes  
**Input Data Availability:** Ambiguous (due to conflicting information)

Given this ambiguity, further clarification would be needed to determine if and how the input data is made available for other evaluations or analyses.

**Paper:**
- **Title:** ""Model-based Performance Analysis for Architecting Cyber-Physical Dynamic Spaces""
- **Publication Year:** 2021
- **Evaluates Property:** Product Quality

Since the question specifically asks about evaluations involving properties like reliability, availability, and maintainability, we can infer that if these were evaluated, they would be part of the broader evaluation of product quality. However, there is no explicit mention in the provided texts.

Therefore, based on the given information:

- The only paper mentioned evaluates product quality but does not explicitly state evaluating reliability, availability, or maintainability.

1. **Evaluation Research with Data**: 
   - Description (6) mentions Evidence 2 which uses true input data.
   - Description (10) also confirms that Evidence 2 does not require additional inputs, implying it relies on existing input data.

Therefore, there is at least one instance where research uses input data as part of its evaluation process. 

2. **Evaluation Research without Data**:
   - Descriptions (1) and (4) focus on evaluating properties such as product quality but do not mention the use of input data explicitly.
   
Thus, there are evaluations that do not rely on explicit input data.

Given this information:

- There is at least one piece of research using input data in its evaluation process.
- There are descriptions indicating evaluations without specific reference to input data usage.

Therefore, we can conclude:
- **Evaluation Research with Data**: At least 1 instance (Evidence 2).
- **Evaluation Research without Data**: At least 1 instance (Descriptions focusing on product quality).

Final Answer: 
There is at least one piece of research using ""Data"" as part of its evaluation process and another that does not explicitly mention the use of data. However, there are no papers specifically labeled as such in the provided descriptions.

Thus:
- **Evaluation Research with Data**: 1
- **Evaluation Research without Data**: 1

None of the descriptions explicitly mention evaluating technical debt or software quality issues related to it. However, Descriptions 6 and 8 refer to evaluations based on ""quality in use,"" which might indirectly relate to technical debt if such evaluations consider how existing technical issues affect user experience and system usability.

Therefore, the most relevant answer is:

**None of the descriptions explicitly address technical debt or software quality attributes related to it. However, Descriptions 6 and 8 mention evaluations based on ""quality in use,"" which might indirectly relate to technical debt if such evaluations consider how existing technical issues affect user experience and system usability.**

If you need a more specific evaluation methodology that directly addresses technical debt, additional information would be required from the paper's content.

Would you like further clarification or another aspect of this analysis?

1. **Evaluation Methods**:
   - **Case Study Evaluation**: The primary method used is a case study approach, which involves analyzing specific aspects of the software system.
   - **Criteria-Based Evaluation**: This focuses on certain criteria relevant to architectural debt and its prioritization.

2. **Properties Focus**:
   - **Quality in Use**: Evaluates how users interact with the product.
   - **Product Quality**: Assesses overall quality attributes of the software system.
   - **Effectiveness**: Includes sub-properties, indicating a detailed analysis of effectiveness metrics.

3. **Guidelines and Data Availability**:
   - The evaluation sometimes follows specific guidelines (e.g., Evidence 1).
   - Other times it does not adhere to any formal guidelines (e.g., Evidence 6).
   - Some evaluations may rely on input data that is not available, impacting the comprehensiveness of certain assessments.

In summary, the study uses a detailed case study approach with specific criteria and properties focused on quality in use, product quality, and effectiveness. The evaluation methods vary in terms of adherence to formal guidelines and availability of necessary data.

- The paper ""Infrastructure-as-Code for Data-Intensive Architectures: A Model-Driven Development Approach"" evaluates one specific research object (referred to as ""the first research object"").
- This evaluation includes properties such as Quality in Use and Product Quality.
- Evaluation methods include Technical Experiment and other unspecified entities.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**The paper evaluates one distinct research object.**

   - Data collection methods include interviews or observations.
   - Key properties such as effectiveness and satisfaction are crucial for understanding the practical implications of the harmonization practices.

In conclusion, this case study employs a detailed evaluation framework to assess the quality and impact of harmonization practices in systems-of-systems architecting contexts. The evaluations focus on system-level and software-level considerations by examining critical properties like effectiveness, freedom from risk, and user satisfaction.

### Final Answer:
The exploratory case study evaluates harmonization practices for systems-of-systems using an evaluation research approach that includes detailed assessments of properties such as effectiveness (with sub-properties), freedom from risk, and satisfaction. The evaluations are conducted through methodologies like interviews or observations without specific guidelines in some cases. This comprehensive framework aims to provide insights into the practical implications of these practices in real-world scenarios.

1. **Quality in Use**: This property focuses on user experience and satisfaction with the system.
2. **Performance Efficiency**: This sub-property assesses how well the system performs under various conditions.
3. **Effectiveness**: This property evaluates the overall effectiveness of the system, considering multiple aspects.

These properties are part of an evaluation process that does not follow a specific method or criteria tied directly to ""architectural concerns for digital twins,"" but they are mentioned as being used in evaluations related to such topics.

### Final Answer:
The evaluation process involves assessing various properties such as:

- **Quality in Use**: Focuses on user experience and satisfaction.
- **Performance Efficiency**: Assesses system performance under different conditions (as a sub-property).
- **Effectiveness**: Evaluates the overall effectiveness of the system, considering multiple aspects.

These properties are used to evaluate research objects related to architectural concerns for digital twins without adhering strictly to a predefined evaluation framework.

1. **Satisfaction**: This property was assessed in descriptions (9) and (6), where it is noted that there are no associated guidelines for these evaluations.
2. **Product Quality**: Descriptions (7) and (10) indicate this property is evaluated, with no guideline specified for the process.

Additionally, description (10) mentions ""Quality of Products,"" which can be interpreted as another form of evaluating product quality.

Therefore, the properties evaluated without a guideline include:
- Satisfaction
- Product Quality

These evaluations were conducted in the context of improving search capabilities for architecture knowledge within online developer communities and other related studies.

However, no specific evaluation technique (like interviews or surveys) is explicitly stated for these evaluations. 

For the first research object related to Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures:
- The evaluation focuses on Product Quality and Quality in Use.

Since there's no indication of a more frequently used method across both objects, we can conclude that:

**The evaluation method focused on Product Quality and Quality in Use was prominently associated with evaluating the first research object.**

Thus, the final answer is:

**Evaluation through Product Quality and Quality in Use.**

1. **Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors (2023)**: The Evaluation Method for Architectural Aspects is a **Case Study**.

2. **Experiments in Curation: Towards Machine-Assisted Construction of Software Architecture Knowledge Bases**: There is no specific data provided about evaluations conducted in 2023 for this paper or similar research objects.

For the other contexts mentioned:

- The texts do not provide sufficient information to determine which evaluation method was most commonly used for Architecture Evolution research objects specifically in 2021.
- No detailed frequency of use for any particular evaluation methods is provided for Semi-automatic Feedback for Improving Architecture Conformance to Microservice Patterns and Practices within the field of Software Architecture and Design, particularly for the year 2023.

Therefore, the most definitive conclusion we can draw from the given information is:

**For ""Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors"" (2023)**:
- The Evaluation Method used for Architectural Aspects is a **Case Study**.

For other research objects and years mentioned, there isn't enough specific data to determine the predominant evaluation methods.

Specifically, it employs an approach classified as **case study or empirical analysis** without adhering to any specific guidelines [1][2]. This evaluation methodology is conducted according to certain criteria but does not follow predefined guidelines, focusing instead on assessing quality properties through refined approaches using observation-based Markov chains [2].

Thus, the primary evaluation method employed in the paper can be summarized as:
- **Evaluation Method**: Case Study/Empirical Analysis
- **Specific Guidelines Followed?**: No

This case study-like approach allows for a detailed examination of the software's quality properties through refined approaches using observation-based Markov chains [1][2].

- The paper titled ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" was evaluated using an Evaluation Method Entity named ""Motivating Example.""
- Another evaluation method mentioned is focused on properties like ""Product Quality.""

However, there is no explicit mention of U. Koziolek's specific contributions or the use of these methods by U. Koziolek.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**The texts do not provide explicit information about U. Koziolek's evaluation methods in relation to ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures."" However, it mentions that evaluations were conducted using methods such as ""Motivating Example"" and focused on properties like ""Product Quality,"" which could be part of the broader methodology used by researchers in this field.**

The empirical study of architectural decay in open-source software, conducted by Duc Le and others, utilized a data science approach as an explicit evaluation method. However, there is no additional information about other specific evaluation methods applied to evaluate accuracy on investigated objects attributed directly to Duc Le.

Therefore, the answer can be summarized as follows:
- **Explicitly stated information:** A data science approach was used.
- **Additional context needed for a comprehensive answer:** Further details or additional sources would be required to address other potential evaluation methods used by Duc Le.

Thus, the primary and explicitly mentioned evaluation method is:

**Data Science Approach**

If more detailed information about other evaluation methods is available from additional sources, it should be incorporated accordingly.

However, there is no specific mention of an evaluation method used by a researcher named David.

Therefore, we cannot definitively state which methods were used by David based on the given information. The paper evaluates its approach through various properties but does not specify any particular evaluation methods attributed to David specifically.

**Final Answer:**
The paper was evaluated using multiple properties such as Product Quality, Quality in Use, and Effectiveness, but there is no specific mention of an evaluation method used by David.

- **Text (2)** mentions ""Evidence 2"" which does not utilize any input data in the context of service-oriented approaches for automotive software.
- **Text (6)** also confirms that this evidence does not rely on input data.

However, these texts do not attribute these contributions to Davide Arcelli. Therefore, we cannot confirm if these contributions are from publications authored by him based solely on the given information.

**Final Answer:**
The provided texts do not contain specific details about publications from Davide Arcelli that investigate without using input data. While there is a mention of ""Evidence 2"" which does not utilize any input data, this contribution is not explicitly attributed to Davide Arcelli. Additional context or references would be needed to confirm if these contributions are part of his work.

Each text focuses on a specific paper and its particular evaluation method(s), but does not provide comparative data to determine which method was most commonly used.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**The provided texts do not contain sufficient information to identify the most frequently used evaluation method for architecture evolution among papers published in 2020. Each text focuses on a specific paper and its particular methods without offering a broader comparison across multiple studies from that year.**

If you need more detailed or comparative data, additional research would be necessary to gather such information.

- In 2020: There are mentions of several studies and papers related to software architecture evolution or specific aspects of software architecture, but none specifically state that they investigate ""Architecture Evolution"" as a research object.
  
- For 2021: No relevant papers investigating Architecture Evolution are mentioned.

Therefore:
- **In 2020:** There is at least one paper (e.g., ""Migrating Towards Microservice Architectures: An Industrial Survey"") that contributes to the field of architecture evolution, but it's not explicitly stated as investigating the research object ""Architecture Evolution.""
  
- **In 2021:** No papers are mentioned specifically investigating Architecture Evolution.

Thus, the answer is:

**In 2020: At least one paper (but no explicit mention of a specific count for ""Architecture Evolution"").**
**In 2021: Zero papers.**

Since no other papers from 2023 using the Evaluation Method Entity ""Argumentation"" are mentioned or described, we cannot definitively conclude which Paper Class is most prevalent for such papers in 2023. Therefore, based on the given data:

**The only paper mentioned belongs to Paper Class 2, but there isn't enough information to determine if it uses ""Argumentation.""**

The descriptions focus primarily on technical contributions and evaluations related to specific aspects such as accuracy and quality of method but do not indicate the use of argumentative methodologies.

Therefore, the answer is:

**No papers use the evaluation methods named ""Argumentation,"" ""Dialectic,"" or a broader evaluative framework called ""Quality of Method"" within the specified timeframe (2015-2023).**

This paper was published in 2019.

No other papers using the same methodology are mentioned specifically between 2019-2021.

Therefore, based on the given information:

- **2019**: 1 study (using Grounded Theory)
- **2020 - 2021**: No studies

Thus, the distribution of papers using Grounded Theory for evaluating architecture conformance to coupling-related patterns and practices in microservices between 2019 and 2021 is:

**2019: 1 study**
**2020-2021: 0 studies**

The final answer is:
There was one paper published in 2019 that used Grounded Theory for evaluating architecture conformance to coupling-related patterns and practices within microservice architectures, with no other papers using the same methodology mentioned between 2020 and 2021.
