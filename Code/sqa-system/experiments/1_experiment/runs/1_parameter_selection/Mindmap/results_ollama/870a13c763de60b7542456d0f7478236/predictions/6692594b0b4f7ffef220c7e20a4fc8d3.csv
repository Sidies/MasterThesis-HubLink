1. The paper ""The Evolution of Technical Debt in the Apache Ecosystem"" has an evaluation method entity named ""Data Science"" and is linked to an evaluation that does not specify the availability of input data.
2. The paper ""Data Stream Operations as First-Class Entities in Component-Based Performance Models"" uses input data that is marked as not available (L1533679:False).

From this, we can conclude:
- There is 1 paper (the first one) that applies the evaluation method ""Data Science"" and does not specify the availability of input data.
- There is 1 paper (the second one) that applies the evaluation method ""Data Science"" and has input data that is not available.

Thus, the number of papers that have not used input data is equal to the number of those that have made their input data available (both are 1). 

Therefore, the answer is that there is no difference in the count; both categories have 1 paper each. 

The question cannot be fully answered with the provided context regarding the specific availability of input data for the first paper.","['(R871800:Paper Class 2, philosophical paper,
