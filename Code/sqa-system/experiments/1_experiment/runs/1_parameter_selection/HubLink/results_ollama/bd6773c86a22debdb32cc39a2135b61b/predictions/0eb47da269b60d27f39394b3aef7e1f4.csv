- The paper ""From a Monolith to a Microservices Architecture: An Approach Based on Transactional Contexts"" was published in 2019 and António Silva is one of its authors. However, there is no specific information about how many research objects he investigated per publication year.

- In the paper ""Constructing a Shared Infrastructure for Software Architecture Analysis and Maintenance,"" which was published in 2021, two distinct research objects are mentioned: ""First Research Object 2"" (named ""Architecture Analysis Method"") and ""Second Research Object 2"" (named ""Architecture Extraction""). However, there is no explicit mention of António Silva's involvement or the number of research objects he investigated per publication year.

- The paper ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns,"" published in 2020 and authored by a group including António Silva, does not provide information about how many specific research objects he investigated per publication year.

- In the paper ""A Complexity Metric for Microservices Architecture Migration"" from 2020, which includes contributions from António Silva, there is no explicit information on how many other research objects were investigated by him per publication year.

- The paper ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures,"" published in 2018, contributes to two specific research objects but does not specify the number of research objects that António Silva specifically investigated or if he was involved as an author.

- In the paper ""Model-based Performance Analysis for Architecting Cyber-Physical Dynamic Spaces"" from 2021, which contributes to two distinct research objects (an entity named ""Architecture Analysis Method"" and architecture patterns for model-based performance analysis), there is no explicit mention of António Silva's direct investigation of these or any other specific details about his involvement in terms of the number of research objects per publication year.

- The paper ""Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors,"" published in 2021, contributes to two distinct research objects: First Research Object 2 and Second Research Object 2. However, there is no information about António Silva or any specific number of research objects investigated by him per publication year.

Therefore, the texts do not provide sufficient detail regarding how many research objects António Silva specifically investigated per publication year.

2. **Another evaluation used input data**: This is mentioned in Description (6) where the paper contributes evidence that utilizes input data.

   - ""The paper contributes evidence that uses input data which is true.""

Given this information:

- There is one instance of an evaluation not using any input data.
- Another instance exists where input data was utilized.

Since there are no explicit mentions of evaluations specifically using a method called ""parametric Markov chain synthesis,"" we cannot definitively state how many evaluations used or did not use this specific methodology. However, based on the given information:

**Final Answer:**
There is one evaluation that did not use any input data and another evaluation that used input data.

- **Reference architecture for decentralized, collaborative, and autonomous robots**: This is a key focus of one paper where field experiments are used to evaluate the deployment process for field optimization experiments.

Additionally, while other descriptions mention evaluations using an Evaluation Method List which includes ""Field Experiment,"" they do not provide specific details about the research objects being evaluated through this method. Therefore, based on the given information:

- The first research object within initiatives involving easy deployment of field optimization experiments is evaluated with a Field Experiment.
- Contributions to design areas, stakeholders, use cases, and requirements for microservices are also mentioned in contexts where evaluations might include ""Field Experiment,"" but specific details about these objects being evaluated through this method are not provided.

In summary:
1. The reference architecture for decentralized, collaborative, and autonomous robots is explicitly evaluated using field experiments.
2. Other research objects related to design areas, stakeholders, use cases, and requirements for microservices may be evaluated with a Field Experiment but specific details are lacking in the provided descriptions.

There is no evidence from the given information that other mentioned research objects such as ""Architecture Analysis Method,"" ""Architectural Aspects,"" or contributions towards cloud-based plant genotyping and phenotyping analysis frameworks are evaluated through field experiments. 

Thus, based on explicit mentions:
- The primary research object evaluated with a Field Experiment method is the reference architecture for decentralized, collaborative, and autonomous robots.

For other objects mentioned in contexts involving evaluations that might include ""Field Experiment,"" further details would be necessary to confirm their evaluation methods specifically as field experiments.

1. **Functional Suitability**: This property evaluates whether the system or component meets its intended functions effectively.
2. **Product Quality**: This assesses the overall quality attributes of the product or system.

For specific evaluations in papers like ""Butterfly Space: An Architectural Approach for Investigating Performance Issues,"" additional properties are considered:

- **Quality in Use**: Evaluates how well the architectural approach is used by end-users.
- **Efficiency**: Assesses the effectiveness and resource utilization of the approach.
- **Accuracy**: Measures the precision and correctness of performance evaluations.

Therefore, the evaluation process that does not adhere to a specific guideline includes properties such as:

1. Functional Suitability
2. Product Quality
3. Quality in Use (for more detailed user-centric evaluations)
4. Efficiency
5. Accuracy

Thus, the final answer is:
The evaluation of research objects without adhering to a formal guideline involves properties such as **Functional Suitability**, **Product Quality**, **Quality in Use**, **Efficiency**, and **Accuracy**.

- Another mentions a single paper titled ""Architectural Decay as Predictor of Issue- and Change-Proneness"" from 2021, which includes Technical Debt among its research objects but does not provide data on investigation frequency over time [2].
- A third text references a case study published in 2018 that explores the identification and prioritization of architectural debt through architectural smells within a large software company, without additional information about yearly publication trends for this topic [3].

**For Uwe Zdun:**
- Uwe Zdun applied an evaluation method in his paper ""Semi-automatic Feedback for Improving Architecture Conformance to Microservice Patterns and Practices.""
- The evaluation included a technical experiment.
- There was also an evaluation that yielded a false result, but the specific context of this false outcome is not detailed.

**For Uliana Karpova and Mikko Raatikainen:**
- The case study titled ""State of the Practice in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)"" evaluates the first research object.
- Evaluation includes properties such as ""Quality in Use"" and satisfaction.
- However, there is no explicit mention of Uliana Karpova or Mikko Raatikainen specifically conducting these evaluations.

Therefore:

**Final Answer:**
Uwe Zdun used a technical experiment for evaluating architecture conformance to microservice patterns. For the case study by contributors including Mikko Raatikainen, it evaluates properties such as ""Quality in Use"" and satisfaction but does not explicitly mention Uliana Karpova or Mikko Raatikainen conducting these evaluations specifically on the first research object.

If you need more specific details or further clarification, please let me know!

- The only explicitly mentioned paper published in 2020 that contributes to Paper Class 2 is ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns.""
- There are no other papers specified as using a particular evaluation method called ""Questionnaire"" or any specific details about an Evaluation Method Entity named ""Argumentation.""

Therefore, the most relevant information points to **Paper Class 2** being the classification for papers published in 2020 that use certain evaluation methods. However, there is no explicit mention of which specific evaluation method (like ""Questionnaire"") these papers might be using.

Given this context and the lack of additional details about other papers or their evaluation methods:

The final answer to your query regarding which Paper Class is most relevant for papers published in 2020 that use a particular evaluation method list, such as including a questionnaire, is **Paper Class 2**. This conclusion is based on the information provided and the specific mention of ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" falling under this classification. 

If more details about other papers or their evaluation methods were available, further clarification might be necessary to pinpoint which Paper Class specifically uses a questionnaire as part of its evaluation method list.
