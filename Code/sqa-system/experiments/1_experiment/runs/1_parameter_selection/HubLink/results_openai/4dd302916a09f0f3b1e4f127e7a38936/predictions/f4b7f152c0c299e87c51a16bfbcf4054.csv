This aligns with findings from other studies, which similarly report the use of tool support but confirm its unavailability [2][3][4][5][6][9][10]. Additionally, conflicting statements exist regarding the availability of tool support in other contexts, suggesting a lack of clarity on this issue [8]. Overall, the consensus across the referenced sources is that while the paper discusses tool support, it does not make any such support available.

Notably, the paper titled ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring"" explicitly states that no input data was utilized in the context of this research object [5]. Additionally, the study on model-based analysis of microservice resiliency patterns contributes evidence suggesting that no input data was used [1]. 

Furthermore, while the study titled ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach"" investigates the Architecture Optimization Method, it also indicates that the input data utilized is classified as false, implying that no input data was effectively used [9]. 

Other studies, such as those discussing Evidence 2 in the context of optimizing architectures for performance, cost, and security, mention that input data is noted to be unavailable, aligning with the inquiry about the Architecture Optimization Method and its relation to the absence of input data [6][7]. Overall, these findings collectively highlight the investigation of the Architecture Optimization Method in scenarios where no input data was effectively utilized.

However, the provided texts do not specify how frequently each property is evaluated in comparison to the other. While both properties are mentioned in multiple studies, including those focused on application programming interfaces, data-centric communication, and service-based software systems, there is no explicit information regarding the frequency of their evaluations relative to one another [1][2][4][5][7][9]. Thus, it remains unclear how often 'Satisfaction' is assessed compared to 'Context Coverage' in the literature on Architecture Evolution.

2. **Functional Suitability** - Identified as a key property, it may also encompass sub-properties and is evaluated in the context of different research objects [3][5][6][9][10].
3. **Quality in Use** - This property is explicitly noted in several studies as part of the evaluation process [2][3][4][7][8].
4. **Performance Efficiency** - Recognized as an important property, particularly in relation to the first research object [2][5].
5. **Effectiveness** - This property is highlighted in the assessment of the first research object, indicating its relevance in evaluating Technical Debt [4][7].
6. **Satisfaction** - Mentioned as a property evaluated in the context of the first research object [8].
7. **Accuracy** - Identified as another key property that may have sub-properties [9].

Additionally, it is noted that the evaluations for these research objects are characterized by the absence of a guideline, which is marked as false in the context of the studies [1][3][4][5][6][10].

1. **Focus Group** - This method evaluates architecture decision making, focusing on properties such as effectiveness and quality in use [1].
2. **Grounded Theory** - Used in multiple papers, this method evaluates satisfaction and quality in use [2][5].
3. **Technical Experiment** - This method is part of a comprehensive evaluation approach and is used to assess various aspects of architecture decision making [3][8].
4. **Questionnaire** - This method is specifically mentioned as an evaluation tool, focusing on functional suitability [4][6].
5. **Interview** - Another method used in the context of evaluating architecture decision making [6].
6. **Data Science** - Identified as a significant evaluation method in one of the studies, focusing on effectiveness and quality in use [7].
7. **Case Study** - This method is also applied in the context of architecture decision making [10].

The evaluations across these methods encompass various properties, including effectiveness, satisfaction, quality in use, and functional suitability. Additionally, some evaluations are characterized by the absence of guidelines, indicating a lack of structured evaluation criteria in certain contexts [8][10].

Specifically, one research object focuses on architectural aspects and is evaluated through a process that lacks a guideline, indicating that no formal evaluation method has been applied [4]. Additionally, the research object known as Architecture Optimization Method has been investigated but also does not have an evaluation method applied [5]. Furthermore, the research object categorized as Architecture Design Method is noted to have an absence of a guideline for evaluation, suggesting that no evaluation method has been applied to it as well [6]. However, the texts do not provide a comprehensive list of all such research objects investigated by Uwe Zdun without evaluation methods [1][2][3][7][8].

- In 2020, there are at least two papers: ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" and ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems."" Additionally, there is a publication discussing a semi-automatic approach to transitioning from a monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture, also from 2020.
- For the year 2018, there are two papers mentioned: ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" and a study on automated provisioning of architecture information for large-scale service-oriented software systems. However, there is no specific information regarding papers that investigate Architecture Extraction published in 2018.

Overall, while there are multiple papers from 2020, the information regarding papers from 2018 is limited, with no specific mentions of Architecture Extraction.
