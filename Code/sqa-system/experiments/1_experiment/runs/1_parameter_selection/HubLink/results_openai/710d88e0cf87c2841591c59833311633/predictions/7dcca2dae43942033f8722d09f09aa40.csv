This suggests a lack of accessible resources or systems to assist in the context of the research. Additionally, there are conflicting statements in other studies regarding the availability of tool support, which further complicates the understanding of the situation [7][10]. Overall, while the paper claims to utilize tool support, it ultimately confirms that such support is not available.

It evaluates various properties such as functional suitability, performance efficiency, and product quality [1][2]. In contrast, the paper 'Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures' also utilizes a comprehensive evaluation process, prominently featuring a technical experiment as one of its methods [2]. 

In summary, while both papers incorporate technical experiments, the first paper additionally includes controlled experiments and evaluates a broader range of properties related to microservice resiliency [1][2].

- In 2017, the paper titled ""Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks"" contributed to two research objects [10].
- In 2018, the study ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" also involved two research objects [7].
- In 2019, the paper ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study"" examined two research objects: 'Architecture Extraction' and 'Architecture Analysis Method' [1].
- In 2020, António Silva authored two papers. The first, ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns,"" contributed to one research object focused on architecture optimization method [3]. The second paper, ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems,"" investigated two research objects [5]. Additionally, the study ""Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation"" also examined two research objects [6].
- In 2021, the paper ""ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns"" investigated two research objects [4], and the study ""Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors"" also contributed to two research objects [8].

Overall, while the specific number of research objects investigated per publication year is not consistently detailed, it is clear that António Silva's work typically involves two research objects per paper, with some exceptions noted in 2020.

However, it is not mentioned in the other studies provided. For instance, the research titled 'DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions' includes controlled and technical experiments but does not reference field experiments [1]. Similarly, the studies 'Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study' [2], 'Identifying and Prioritizing Architectural Debt Through Architectural Smells: A Case Study in a Large Software Company' [4], 'Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis' [7], and the study on semi-automatic feedback for improving architecture conformance to microservice patterns [8] do not mention the field experiment as part of their evaluation methods. Overall, the only paper that applies the evaluation method 'Field Experiment' is the one related to decentralized, collaborative, and autonomous robots [3].

Additionally, another paper has made its input data available, indicating that there is at least one paper that has made its input data accessible [2][9]. However, the texts do not provide a clear count of the total number of papers that have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available, leading to some ambiguity in the overall assessment [3][6][10].

One notable study is titled ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring,"" which explicitly states that no input data was used in the context of this research object [4]. 

Additionally, while the study ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach"" also investigates the Architecture Optimization Method, it suggests that the input data is characterized by the absence of specific attributes, inferring that no input data was effectively used [6]. 

However, other studies, such as ""ADOOPLA - Combining Product-Line- and Product-Level Criteria in Multi-objective Optimization of Product Line Architectures,"" mention that input data is utilized, but it is also noted that there is no input data available for this evidence [5]. Similarly, the study on optimizing architectures for performance, cost, and security includes contributions that utilize input data, yet it is indicated that there is no input data available for this evidence [3]. 

Overall, while some papers reference the Architecture Optimization Method, the clear indication of investigations that confirm no input data was used is primarily found in the studies mentioned above [4][6].

However, several papers mentioned are classified under Paper Class 2, which is characterized by evaluation research. These include titles such as ""A Platform Architecture for Multi-Tenant Blockchain-Based Systems,"" ""Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks,"" ""An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots,"" ""A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing,"" and ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Additionally, the paper ""An Architecture-Driven Adaptation Approach for Big Data Cyber Security Analytics"" also falls under Paper Class 2, but it does not clarify the frequency of this classification in relation to the investigation of reliability [7]. Overall, while Paper Class 2 is noted, the texts do not provide a definitive answer regarding the most frequent classification for papers focused on reliability.

1. **Architecture Patterns**: This includes architectural assumptions and design methods, which are evaluated for their functional suitability and effectiveness [1][2][9].
2. **Product Quality**: This property is consistently evaluated across various studies, focusing on aspects such as accuracy, quality of method, and performance efficiency [1][4][8][10].
3. **Architecture Optimization Method**: This research object is specifically evaluated for its effectiveness and quality in use [5][10].
4. **Architecture Description Language**: This entity is also part of the evaluation process, although its specific role is less detailed [6].

The evaluation methods employed in these studies include questionnaires, interviews, case studies, and controlled experiments, which help assess properties such as satisfaction, robustness, and quality of method [2][4][7][9]. Overall, the research focuses on evaluating architectural conformance to microservice patterns and practices, as well as the effectiveness of various architectural approaches in software design.

Key properties identified across various studies are:

1. **Product Quality** - This property is consistently mentioned as a significant aspect evaluated in multiple research objects [1][4][6][8][9][10].
2. **Functional Suitability** - Identified as a crucial property in several evaluations, it reflects how well the system meets specified requirements [4][7][9][10].
3. **Quality in Use** - This property assesses the user experience and satisfaction, and it is noted in various studies as a critical evaluation aspect [2][8][10].
4. **Performance Efficiency** - This property evaluates how well the system performs under specific conditions and is highlighted in several contexts [2][4].
5. **Effectiveness** - This property measures the extent to which the intended outcomes are achieved and is mentioned in the context of different research objects [5][8].
6. **Quality of Method** - This property evaluates the methodologies employed in the research and is noted in several studies [3][6].

Additionally, it is emphasized that the evaluations for these properties are characterized by the absence of a formal evaluation guideline, which is a common theme across the studies [1][4][5][6][7][8][9].

The explicitly stated properties are functional suitability, quality in use, product quality, effectiveness, and efficiency. Additionally, the evaluation employs a method identified as a questionnaire [6]. Furthermore, the evaluation process is characterized by the absence of a guideline [4]. Overall, the properties assessed encompass a comprehensive evaluation framework that addresses various characteristics related to the Architecture Design Method [1][4][8].

1. **Focus Group** - This method is used to evaluate properties such as effectiveness and quality in use [1].
2. **Questionnaire** - This method assesses properties including context coverage, quality in use, and functional suitability [2][5].
3. **Interview** - This method evaluates context coverage, quality in use, and satisfaction [3].
4. **Grounded Theory** - Applied in multiple contexts, this method evaluates properties such as satisfaction, accuracy, and quality of method [4][6].
5. **Data Science** - This method focuses on effectiveness and quality in use, although it is characterized by the absence of a guideline [7].
6. **Field Experiment** - This method examines effectiveness, quality in use, and satisfaction, and is guided by established guidelines [8].
7. **Technical Experiment** - This method is noted for its evaluation of specific research objects, characterized by the absence of a guideline [9].
8. **Case Study** - This method evaluates accuracy and quality of method, with a guideline indicating a false outcome [10].

Overall, the evaluation processes in these studies encompass a range of properties, including effectiveness, quality in use, satisfaction, context coverage, and accuracy, with varying characteristics regarding the presence or absence of guidelines.

These methods include the Technical Experiment and Questionnaire. Additionally, a Controlled Experiment is mentioned as another evaluation method, although it is not explicitly linked to the property Efficiency. While various studies reference different evaluation methods, the total number of distinct methods specifically applied by Monschein for evaluating Efficiency is not clearly stated in the provided texts [1][4][6].

While several studies contribute to various research objects, such as architecture decision making and architecture optimization methods, the evaluations of these objects are characterized by the presence of guidelines or evaluation processes. Specifically, the second research object, identified as the Architecture Optimization Method, is noted to be evaluated through a method characterized as false, suggesting that it may not have undergone a proper evaluation method [5]. Additionally, the first research object related to architecture design methods is mentioned as lacking a guideline, indicating that no evaluation method has been applied in that context [6]. However, a comprehensive list of all research objects without evaluation methods is not provided in the sources [1][2][4][7][8].

However, there is no information provided regarding the number of papers investigating the research object Architecture Evolution for that year [1][3]. 

In the publication year 2021, the work titled ""Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution"" and ""Continuous API Evolution in Heterogeneous Enterprise Software Systems"" were published. Nonetheless, there is no information regarding the number of papers investigating Architecture Evolution for that year either [2][4]. 

Thus, the final answer is that while specific studies were published in both years, the exact number of papers investigating Architecture Evolution in 2020 and 2021 is not available.

One such paper is titled ""Designing Robust Software Systems through Parametric Markov Chain Synthesis."" Although it contributes to the architecture design method, it is noted that the evidence presented utilizes input data, which is characterized as not available, indicating that the paper does not use input data [1].

Another relevant study is ""Mapping Features to Source Code through Product Line Architecture: Traceability and Conformance."" This paper also contributes to the architecture design method; however, there is no explicit information provided regarding whether this research object has used input data or not [2].

Additionally, a paper focused on the synthesis and quantitative verification of tradeoff spaces for families of software systems was published in 2017. This paper contributes to the architecture design method and is supported by evidence indicating that the input data is not available [3]. 

In summary, the papers that investigate the Architecture Design Method in 2017 include those that either explicitly state the absence of input data or lack clarity on the use of input data.
