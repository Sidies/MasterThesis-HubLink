Additionally, it utilizes a comprehensive list of evaluation methods, which may also include argumentation and considerations of various properties such as functional suitability, quality in use, and product quality [2]. 

In contrast, the paper titled 'Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures' applies a technical experiment as part of its evaluation methods [1][3]. However, specific details regarding the full range of evaluation methods used in this second paper are not provided in the texts. 

In summary, the evaluation methods for the first paper include a controlled experiment, while the second paper is noted for its use of a technical experiment.

One paper indicates that it utilizes input data characterized by the absence of any constraints, while another paper states that the input data required for the framework is not available [1]. Additionally, one paper confirms that it utilizes input data marked as None, indicating that it has not used input data, while another paper confirms that its input data is available [2]. 

There are also instances where papers indicate that they utilize input data, but it is characterized as false or not available [3][4][6][7]. Specifically, one contribution utilizes input data but notes that it is not available, leading to the inference that this paper has not made its input data available [4]. 

Overall, while there is evidence that at least one paper has made its input data available, the exact number of papers that have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available is not clearly specified in the texts [5][9][10]. Thus, a direct comparison cannot be definitively made based on the provided information.

The paper titled ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring"" explicitly states that no input data was used in the context of this research object [2]. Additionally, the study titled ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach"" mentions that while evidence related to the research object suggests the presence of specific attributes, it indicates a false status regarding input data, implying that no input data was effectively utilized [1]. 

Furthermore, the study on optimizing architectures for performance, cost, and security notes that while evidence is mentioned, it does not have input data available [4]. Similarly, the research on model-based analysis of microservice resiliency patterns also contributes evidence indicating that no input data was used [8]. 

Overall, the papers that investigate the Architecture Optimization Method and indicate that no input data was used include ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring"" [2] and the study on model-based analysis of microservice resiliency patterns [8].

However, none of the provided texts specify how frequently each property is evaluated in comparison to one another. While 'Satisfaction' is mentioned as being evaluated in various studies, including those focused on application programming interfaces and microservice architectures, 'Context Coverage' is not consistently referenced or evaluated alongside it. Therefore, there is no direct comparison available regarding the evaluation frequency of 'Satisfaction' compared to 'Context Coverage' in the literature on Architecture Evolution [1][2][3][4][5][6][7].

Key properties identified across various sources are:

1. **Quality in Use** - This property is frequently mentioned as a significant aspect of the evaluations [1][7][8][9].
2. **Product Quality** - Identified as a crucial property in multiple evaluations, it reflects the overall quality of the product being assessed [5][6][8][10].
3. **Functional Suitability** - This property is noted as important in the context of evaluating the effectiveness of the systems [2][9][10].
4. **Effectiveness** - Highlighted as a significant property in the assessment of the first research object [1][7].
5. **Performance Efficiency** - Recognized as a key aspect in the evaluation of certain research objects [3][10].
6. **Maintainability** - This property is also evaluated, indicating the ease with which a system can be maintained [6][8].
7. **Satisfaction** - Mentioned as a property with sub-properties, reflecting user satisfaction with the system [9].

Overall, these evaluations are characterized by the absence of a formal guideline, which suggests that the assessments may not follow standardized methods, potentially impacting the reliability of the results [4][5][7][10].

1. **Focus Group**: This method emphasizes properties such as effectiveness and quality in use [1].
2. **Case Study**: This method is characterized by the absence of guidelines and focuses on properties like effectiveness [2].
3. **Questionnaire**: This method is used to assess properties including functional suitability, context coverage, and quality in use [3][8][10].
4. **Technical Experiment**: This method is noted for evaluating performance efficiency and functional suitability, and is characterized by the absence of guidelines [6][7].
5. **Grounded Theory**: This method is applied in specific studies and focuses on properties such as accuracy, satisfaction, and quality in use [4][9].

Overall, the evaluations are characterized by varying properties, including effectiveness, quality in use, functional suitability, and the presence or absence of guidelines in the evaluation process.

While some of these research objects have undergone evaluation methods, the specific research objects to which no evaluation method has been applied are not explicitly detailed in the provided texts. However, it is noted that one of the research objects, identified as the Architecture Optimization Method, has been investigated without an associated evaluation method [4]. Other research objects mentioned, such as architecture decision making and architecture design methods, are part of broader research object lists but do not have clear indications of lacking evaluation methods [1][2][3][5][6][7][8]. Overall, the texts do not provide a comprehensive list of research objects without evaluation methods beyond the mention of the Architecture Optimization Method.

However, the most frequently applied method is identified as the case study [1][2][3][9][10]. Additionally, the technical experiment is noted as a significant evaluation method in some studies [4][7]. Other methods mentioned include the questionnaire and various approaches used in specific studies, but the predominant method remains the case study [8][9][10].

In contrast, several studies were published in 2021, including ""Model-based Performance Analysis for Architecting Cyber-Physical Dynamic Spaces,"" ""Continuous API Evolution in Heterogeneous Enterprise Software Systems,"" and ""Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution.""

The paper titled ""Designing Robust Software Systems through Parametric Markov Chain Synthesis"" was published in 2017 and contributes to the Architecture Design Method; however, it explicitly states that it utilizes input data [1]. Similarly, ""An Architecture Framework for Modelling and Simulation of Situational-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems,"" also published in 2017, investigates the same research object but confirms the presence of input data, which is characterized as false [2]. Lastly, the study ""Mapping Features to Source Code through Product Line Architecture: Traceability and Conformance,"" while contributing to the Architecture Design Method, does not provide any information indicating that it investigates this method without using input data [3]. Therefore, there are no papers from 2017 that investigate the Architecture Design Method without using input data.
