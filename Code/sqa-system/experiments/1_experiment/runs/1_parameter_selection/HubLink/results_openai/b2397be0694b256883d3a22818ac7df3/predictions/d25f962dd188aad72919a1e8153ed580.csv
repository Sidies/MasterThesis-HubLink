• In 2019, António Silva co‐authored the paper “From a Monolith to a Microservices Architecture: An Approach Based on Transactional Contexts,” which was associated with one research object [3].

• In 2020, António Silva was listed as an author of “A Complexity Metric for Microservices Architecture Migration” [1] and “Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns” [6]. Each of these papers is described as having one research object.

• In 2021, while the information is somewhat indirect, assuming António Silva is the author in question as noted in the texts [4] and [5], the paper(s) published that year investigated two research objects.

Thus, per the publication years:
 – 2019: one research object,
 – 2020: one research object per paper, and
 – 2021: two research objects.

According to one source [1], the paper “Quality Evaluation of PaaS Cloud Application Design Using Generated Prototypes” evaluates Reliability. A second source [2] points to “A Platform Architecture for Multi-Tenant Blockchain-Based Systems” as including an evaluation of that property. In contrast, a third source [3] indicates that the evaluation of Reliability appears only as a sub-property in “A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing” and concludes that one paper evaluates Reliability. 

Thus, while sources [1] and [2] each report a different paper evaluating Reliability, source [3] suggests that only one paper does so. The provided texts therefore contain conflicting information regarding the total number of papers evaluated.

• No paper is conclusively reported to have made its input data available. [1], [3], [6], [7]

It should be noted that a couple of partial answers ([4] and [5]) presented conflicting information (indicating both that input data was not available and that it was available for the same paper). However, the majority of the evidence indicates that the paper using the Data Science evaluation method did use input data, but that input data was not made available.

For example:

• [1] In “Optimising Architectures for Performance, Cost, and Security” the contexts referring to Evidence 2 state that the input data is either marked “False” or noted as “not available.”

• [2] In “Modeling of Parametric Dependencies for Performance Prediction of Component-Based Software Systems at Run-Time” there are two explicit pieces of evidence (one stating the input data “is not available” and another marking it “False”) showing that no input data was used.

• [3] In “ADOOPLA – Combining Product-Line- and Product-Level Criteria in Multi-objective Optimization of Product Line Architectures” the Evidence 2 contribution is explicitly associated with attributes that describe the input data as “None, False” or “not available.”

• [4] In “InMap: Automated Interactive Code-to-Architecture Mapping Recommendations” the corresponding descriptions unequivocally indicate that for Evidence 2 the input data is either “None,” “False,” or simply “not available.”

Additional papers are also mentioned (such as [5], [7], [9], and [10]) where at least one description indicates that the contribution’s input data was not available or was marked as false. (For instance, [5] notes two descriptions with the indications “False” and “not available.” Similarly, [7] and [9] contain instances where one text states that the input data is “not available,” and [10] includes a text (text 4) that clearly indicates that input data was not used, although some other texts provide conflicting information.) 

Thus, multiple papers investigating the research object “Architecture Optimization Method” present at least one instance (typically in Evidence 2) where it is explicitly stated that no input data was used. Each of these conclusions is drawn from the corresponding partial answers [1] through [10], with the papers in [1], [2], [3], and [4] providing unambiguous evidence for the lack of input data in the context of the research object’s investigation.

In every contribution the two research objects are referred to simply as First Research Object 2 and Second Research Object 2, although the associated research object entities (that is, the particular names attached to these research objects in different contributions) vary across the texts.

For example, one set of texts shows that First Research Object 2 is linked to entities such as “Architecture Analysis Method” [1, 2, 7] and even “Architecture Description” or “Architecture Description Language” when said object appears in other contributions [4, 9]. In contrast, Second Research Object 2 is associated with entities such as “Architecture Analysis Method” [1, 7], “Architectural Aspects” [2, 3, 7] or appears as “Reference Architecture” [3] or “Architecture Design Method” [8, 9]. One contribution even mentions a Second Research Object 2 termed “Architecture Optimization Method” [1].

In summary, papers classified as philosophical (Paper Class 2) investigate two research objects:
• First Research Object 2 – whose associated entities include, among others, “Architecture Analysis Method”, “Architecture Description”, “Architecture Description Language” and “Architectural Aspects” [1, 2, 4, 7, 9].
• Second Research Object 2 – whose associated entities include “Architecture Analysis Method”, “Architectural Aspects”, “Reference Architecture”, “Architecture Design Method” (and in one instance “Architecture Optimization Method”) [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9].

Thus, while the specific names tied to each research object vary by the contribution, all contributions of the philosophical paper class consistently investigate these two research objects (cited simply as First Research Object 2 and Second Research Object 2) with their respective entity associations as noted in the individual texts [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9].

• Product Quality [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]  
• Quality in Use [2], [3], [4], [5], [8], [9]  
• Functional Suitability [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]  
• Effectiveness [2], [3], [4], [5], [8]  
• Maintainability [1], [2]  
• Compatibility [2]  
• Reliability [2], [9]  
• Satisfaction [3], [5]  
• Quality of Method [4], [7], [10]  
• Accuracy [4], [7], [10]  
• Efficiency [5]  
• Performance efficiency [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]  
• Usability [6]  
• Security [9]  
• Context coverage [9]

In summary, when an evaluation guideline is not followed, papers investigating Technical Debt assess a variety of product- and use-related properties—ranging from Product Quality, Quality in Use, and Functional Suitability to more specific aspects like Performance Efficiency, Quality of Method, and Accuracy—with additional considerations for aspects such as Maintainability, Compatibility, and Reliability, among others [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].

For instance, one passage [1] states that an evaluation employing “Data Science” was used, while two separate descriptions [2] and [4] indicate that “Case Study” was applied in multiple instances. Other passages report the use of “Motivating Example” [3], “Technical Experiment” [5,6,8], and “Verification” [8] in different contexts. However, none of the texts clearly rank or indicate that one particular method is the most frequently applied in papers focusing on Technical Debt. 

Thus, based solely on the provided information, it is not possible to conclusively state that any single evaluation method has been applied most often in papers investigating Technical Debt.

For example, one partial answer [1] specifies that the evaluation explicitly involved a top‐level property named Product Quality (with sub-properties including Functional Suitability, Usability, and Performance efficiency). Other texts [2] and [4] mention that the evaluation included several properties such as Product Quality, Quality in Use, Functional Suitability, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Satisfaction (and in [4] Quality in Use, Satisfaction, and Effectiveness), while yet another contribution [6] also indicates that Product Quality (accompanied by a sub‐property, Compatibility) played a role. In addition, one text [7] points out that Quality in Use was a key evaluation property, and [3] highlights Functional Suitability as explicitly associated with the evaluation. 

Thus, the evaluation of Architecture Design Method is not limited to a single property. It appears that different parts of the paper report multiple evaluation properties—including Product Quality (often presented as the top‐level property), Quality in Use, and Functional Suitability, along with others such as Effectiveness, Efficiency, Satisfaction, Performance efficiency, and Compatibility.

• In one paper, the evaluation was conducted through a Questionnaire and another through a Focus Group [1].

• In several contributions the evaluation relied on an Evaluation Method List that explicitly named Grounded Theory as the applied method [3][5][6].

• In another paper, a Controlled Experiment was explicitly mentioned as the evaluation method [4]. (It should be noted that in this instance the research object is tied to “Architecture Description Language” rather than Architecture Decision Making, although it is included in the collected texts.)

• Yet in another paper, the evaluation involved Technical Experiment and Benchmark (with later sources further clarifying that one contribution was associated with a Technical Experiment, and another description actually mentioned both Controlled Experiment and Technical Experiment for a paper that focuses on Architecture Decision Making) [7][8].

In summary, across the contributions related to investigations of Architecture Decision Making, Uwe Zdun’s papers explicitly employ evaluation methods such as Questionnaire, Focus Group, Grounded Theory, Controlled Experiment, Technical Experiment, and Benchmark [1][3][4][7][8]. Additional details (such as evaluation properties like Quality in Use, Accuracy, or the flag “False” indicating the absence of a guideline or evaluation method) were mentioned in some texts but do not represent distinct evaluation methods themselves [2][9][10].

• Partial answer [1] indicates that a “Case Study” was used.
• Partial answer [6] indicates that both a “Questionnaire” and an “Interview” were used.
• Partial answer [7] confirms that a “Questionnaire” was applied in the context of Architecture Evolution.

When we combine these and rank them in descending alphabetical order, the resulting order is:

1. Questionnaire  
2. Interview  
3. Case Study

Thus, the evaluation methods applied in the context of Architecture Evolution, ranked in descending alphabetical order, are: Questionnaire, Interview, Case Study.

On one hand, according to sources [1] and [2], the research object Architecture Extraction is investigated in a paper published in 2018, and there is no information regarding its investigation in any paper published in 2020. On the other hand, source [3] states that the investigation of Architecture Extraction is included as a research object in a paper published in 2020, with no evidence of such an investigation in 2018. 

Thus, while sources [1] and [2] indicate that Architecture Extraction was investigated in the 2018 publication without a corresponding investigation in 2020, source [3] suggests the opposite trend. Without additional clarification, the texts present conflicting accounts regarding the comparison between 2018 and 2020.

• Some sources indicate that two research objects were investigated. In this view, First Research Object 2 is consistently shown to have been evaluated (for example, see [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], and [10]). In contrast, according to [1] and [9] the second research object (“Second Research Object 2”) is mentioned in several texts but—despite being noted in evaluation descriptions—no specific evaluation method is explicitly associated with it.

• Another source ([8]) describes a research object named “Architecture Description Language” that is mentioned without any indication of an evaluation method having been applied, while it also notes that another research object (First Research Object 2) was evaluated.

• Yet other sources ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], and [10]) state that all identified research objects underwent evaluation with an explicitly applied evaluation method.

In summary, the provided texts yield conflicting information. On one hand, some partial answers ([1] and [9]) report that Second Research Object 2 did not have an evaluation method applied, and another ([8]) points to “Architecture Description Language” as lacking an evaluation method. On the other hand, several answers ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], and [10]) clearly indicate that each research object mentioned received an evaluation method. 

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, there is no single unequivocal answer—some sources suggest that either Second Research Object 2 or “Architecture Description Language” has no evaluation method applied, while others assert that every research object was evaluated. The discrepancy among the texts means that the research object investigated by Uwe Zdun to which no evaluation method has been applied is not conclusively determined from the available information.

Two sources ([1] and [2]) indicate that a paper published in 2021 was evaluated using Data Science—reporting one instance for 2021 and none for 2019 or 2020. In contrast, source [3] reports that a paper from 2019 was evaluated using Data Science (and no instance was mentioned for 2020 or 2021). Finally, sources [4] and [5] exclusively mention an evaluation using Data Science in a paper from 2018, thereby implying that no papers from 2019, 2020, or 2021 were evaluated using this method.

Thus, based solely on the provided texts:
• According to [1] and [2], there is 1 instance in 2021.  
• According to [3], there is 1 instance in 2019.  
• According to [4] and [5], there are no instances from 2019 to 2021.

Therefore, while one set of texts attributes a 2021 occurrence, another attributes a 2019 occurrence, and yet another set indicates no occurrences during 2019–2021.

Other texts ([1], [6], [7], and [8]) do not provide any explicit information for the years 2020 or 2021. 

Thus, combining the information available in the texts:
 – In 2020: 1 paper

However, three papers have been argued in different sources as satisfying all of the following conditions: published in 2017, investigating the research object Architecture Design Method, and (according to at least one explicit description) not having used input data:

• “Design Criteria to Architect Continuous Experimentation for Self-Driving Vehicles” is reported as having been published in 2017, investigating Architecture Design Method, and—with two entries noting that although Evidence 2 mentions input data, the associated flag is False (or the data is “not available”)—effectively not using input data [4].

• “Microservice Ambients: An Architectural Meta-Modelling Approach for Microservice Granularity” is described as published in 2017 and investigating Architecture Design Method, and while there are several statements about Evidence 2, one explicit note states that the input data is not used [9].

• “An Architecture Framework for Modelling and Simulation of Situational-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems” is also reported as published in 2017. It investigates Architecture Design Method (via its contribution labeled First Research Object 2), and although there is conflicting information regarding Evidence 2, another source clearly states that the associated input data flag is False—indicating that input data was not used [10].

Thus, according to the provided texts [4], [9], and [10], these three papers are the ones that most closely satisfy all three conditions.

Some texts identify a paper from 2020 ([1], [4], [8]) while others explicitly associate the investigation with a paper from 2018 ([2], [3], [9]). In addition, there are sources that indicate a paper published in 2019 ([5], [7]). 

Thus, if all texts are taken into account, during the period 2018 to 2020 there are reports of:
• A paper from 2018,
• A paper from 2019, and
• A paper from 2020.

This shows that within the 2018–2020 timeframe the investigation of Architecture Extraction, as provided, is distributed across three different years with one paper in each year.
