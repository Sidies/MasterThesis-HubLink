It evaluates various properties such as functional suitability, performance efficiency, and product quality [1][3]. In contrast, the evaluation methods used in the paper 'Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures' are not explicitly detailed in the provided texts, making a direct comparison challenging [2]. However, it is noted that this paper also utilizes a technical experiment as part of its evaluation process [3]. Thus, while both papers incorporate technical experiments, the first paper additionally includes controlled experiments and evaluates a broader range of properties.

Specifically, in 2017, his paper ""Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks"" contributed to two research objects [9]. In 2018, the paper ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" also involved two research objects [3]. In 2019, the study ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study"" examined two research objects [5]. In 2020, his works, including ""Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation"" and ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns,"" each investigated two research objects [4][6]. Additionally, the paper ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" published in 2020 also focused on two research objects [7]. Lastly, in 2021, both ""ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns"" and ""Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors"" contributed to two research objects each [1][10]. 

While the specific total number of research objects investigated per publication year is not explicitly stated in the texts, it is clear that each paper consistently involved two research objects.

Specifically, one contribution identified as Evidence 2 utilizes input data, but it is characterized as false and not available [1][2][9]. This suggests that at least one paper has not made its input data available. Additionally, there are papers that have utilized input data that is confirmed to be true and available [3][8]. However, the texts do not provide explicit counts of how many papers have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available [4][7][10]. Therefore, while it can be inferred that there are papers that have not made their input data available, the exact numbers remain unspecified.

One such paper is titled ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring,"" which explicitly states that no input data was used in the context of this research object [2]. 

Another relevant study is ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach,"" which also suggests that while input data is mentioned, it is characterized by the absence of specific attributes, implying that no input data was effectively utilized [5]. 

Additionally, the study ""ADOOPLA - Combining Product-Line- and Product-Level Criteria in Multi-objective Optimization of Product Line Architectures"" contributes to the Architecture Optimization Method and notes that although evidence utilizes input data, it is stated that there is no input data available for this evidence [3]. 

Overall, these studies collectively indicate that the Architecture Optimization Method has been explored in contexts where no input data was effectively used, despite some references to input data that may not be valid.

1. **Architectural Patterns**: This includes architectural assumptions and architecture design methods, which are evaluated through structured processes.
2. **Architecture Optimization Method**: This is another significant research object that focuses on optimizing architectural designs.
3. **Properties Evaluated**: Various properties are assessed, including:
   - Accuracy
   - Quality of Method
   - Product Quality
   - Functional Suitability
   - Performance Efficiency
   - Effectiveness
   - Satisfaction
   - Robustness

The evaluation methods employed in these studies include a range of approaches such as controlled experiments, technical experiments, case studies, questionnaires, and interviews. These methods are integral to the evaluation process, focusing on aspects like product quality, functional suitability, and overall effectiveness in the context of software architecture and design [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].

1. **Quality of Method** - This property assesses the overall quality of the methodologies employed in the research [1].
2. **Performance Efficiency** - Evaluated in the context of the first research object, this property examines how efficiently the methods perform [2][4].
3. **Efficiency** - This property is also considered in the evaluations, focusing on the effectiveness of the methods used [2].
4. **Quality in Use** - Identified as a significant property in the evaluation of the first research object, it reflects how well the product meets user needs [5][10].
5. **Product Quality** - This property is consistently evaluated across various studies, indicating its importance in assessing technical debt [3][4][9][10].
6. **Maintainability** - This property is evaluated in relation to the first research object, highlighting the ease with which the product can be maintained [3].
7. **Functional Suitability** - This property is characterized by sub-properties and is evaluated in relation to both the first and second research objects [4][6].
8. **Effectiveness** - This property is noted as significant in the overall assessment of the first research object [7][10].
9. **Accuracy** - This property is specifically mentioned in the context of evaluating the methods used [8].

Overall, the evaluations across these studies are characterized by the absence of a formal evaluation guideline, which is noted as false in the context of the research [1][3][4][6][10].

In 2018, it is referenced in a study focused on a platform for the automated provisioning of architecture information for large-scale service-oriented software systems, as well as in a study exploring the transition from a monolithic architecture style to a microservice architecture. In 2020, Architecture Extraction is discussed in the context of a study on microservice resiliency patterns and another publication regarding technical architectures for automotive systems. However, there is no specific information provided regarding the frequency of investigation of Architecture Extraction in papers published in 2018 compared to those published in 2020 [1][2][3][4][5].

In 2018, two studies were published: ""Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study"" and ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" [2][3]. Additionally, a publication titled ""The platform for the automated provisioning of architecture information for large-scale service-oriented software systems"" was also released in 2018 [7]. 

In 2020, several papers were published, including ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems,"" ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns,"" and ""From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach"" [1][5][6]. 

However, there is no information provided regarding any papers investigating Architecture Extraction published in 2018 or 2020 that are not already mentioned. Furthermore, a study titled ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study"" was published in 2019, but it does not pertain to the years in question [4].
