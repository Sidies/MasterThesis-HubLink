Additionally, another source mentions that tool support is available and confirms this to be true, further complicating the understanding of its availability [2]. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no tool support available for the implementation discussed in the paper.

Thus, while the paper addresses at least five threats to validity, the status of these threats varies, with some confirmed as true and others as false.

- In 2017, his paper titled ""Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks"" contributed to two research objects [10].
- In 2018, he investigated one research object, identified as Reference Architecture, in the paper ""Providing Context as a Service Using Service-Oriented Mobile Indie Fog and Opportunistic Computing"" [1]. Additionally, another paper published in the same year, ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures,"" contributed to two research objects [8].
- In 2019, the paper ""From a Monolith to a Microservices Architecture: An Approach Based on Transactional Contexts"" included one evaluated research object [4].
- In 2020, two papers were published: ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns,"" which contributed to two research objects [5], and ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns,"" which contributed to one research object [6].
- In 2021, the paper ""ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns"" investigated two research objects, focusing on architectural aspects and evaluation [2].

Overall, while the specific number of research objects investigated by António Silva per publication year is not consistently detailed across all texts, it is clear that he has engaged with multiple research objects in his work.

Additionally, there are papers that have used input data but have not made it available, as noted in several sources [3][5][7]. However, the texts do not provide explicit information on the total number of papers that have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available [6][8][9].

Specifically, the study titled ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach"" suggests that while evidence related to this research object utilizes input data, it indicates a false status regarding the presence of input data, implying that no input data was used [3]. Additionally, the paper ""Combining Product-Line- and Product-Level Criteria in Multi-objective Optimization of Product Line Architectures"" explicitly states that no input data was available for the evidence related to the Architecture Optimization Method [8]. Furthermore, the study ""An Architecture-Driven Adaptation Approach for Big Data Cyber Security Analytics"" also indicates that while input data was characterized as utilized, it suggests that no effective input data was used in the context of the Architecture Optimization Method [10]. 

In summary, these studies collectively highlight the investigation of the Architecture Optimization Method while indicating that no input data was effectively utilized.

1. **Questionnaire**: This method focuses on properties such as functional suitability, product quality, context coverage, and quality in use [1][9].
   
2. **Focus Group**: This evaluation method assesses effectiveness, quality in use, context coverage, and satisfaction [2].

3. **Interview**: This method also evaluates functional suitability and product quality, although it lacks a guiding framework [3].

4. **Grounded Theory**: Used in specific studies, this method evaluates properties like satisfaction and quality in use, and in some cases, it is guided by established guidelines [4][6].

5. **Data Science**: This method is employed in qualitative studies to assess effectiveness and quality in use, but it does not follow a guideline [7].

6. **Technical Experiment**: This method is part of a comprehensive evaluation approach, focusing on functional suitability and product quality, and is characterized by the absence of a guideline [8].

7. **Case Study**: This evaluation method assesses effectiveness and quality in use, but it is also noted for lacking a guiding framework [10].

Overall, the evaluation processes across these methods encompass various properties, including effectiveness, quality in use, functional suitability, and satisfaction, with some evaluations guided by established guidelines while others are not.

However, there is no information available regarding the frequency of investigation of Architecture Extraction in papers published in that year.

In contrast, in the year 2020, several papers addressed related topics, including ""COCOS: A Scalable Architecture for Containerized Heterogeneous Systems"" [1] and ""Butterfly Space: An Architectural Approach for Investigating Performance Issues"" [4]. Additionally, a publication explored the transition from a monolithic architecture style to a microservice architecture [5]. Despite these publications, there is no information provided about the investigation of Architecture Extraction in papers published in 2020.

Therefore, while Architecture Extraction was mentioned in 2018, the comparison with 2020 is hindered by a lack of information regarding its investigation in that year.

However, several studies contribute to various research objects, with some undergoing evaluation while others do not have clear guidelines or methods associated with their evaluation.

1. The first research object, related to architectural decision making, is mentioned in the context of supporting architectural decision making on data management in microservice architectures [1]. Although it contributes to this area, it is not stated whether any evaluation method has been applied.

2. Another study focuses on architecture conformance to coupling-related patterns in microservices, which also contributes to the first research object. However, the specific research objects that lack evaluation methods are not detailed [2].

3. The research object list includes entities such as architecture decision making and architectural aspects, but again, the texts do not specify which research objects have not been evaluated [3][5].

4. The second research object, which is part of a research object list, is evaluated through various methods, but there are indications that some aspects may not have effective evaluation methods applied to them [4][6][9].

In summary, while the texts discuss various contributions to research objects and their evaluation statuses, they do not provide explicit information on which specific research objects have not had evaluation methods applied.

This publication discusses architectural decay as a predictor of issue- and change-proneness, indicating the use of Data Science for evaluation. However, there is no information available regarding the evaluation of research objects using the Data Science method for the years 2019 and 2020, as the other publications from those years do not provide details on this evaluation method [1][2][3][5][6]. Therefore, while Data Science was utilized in 2021, the frequency of evaluations using this method in 2019 and 2020 remains unspecified.
