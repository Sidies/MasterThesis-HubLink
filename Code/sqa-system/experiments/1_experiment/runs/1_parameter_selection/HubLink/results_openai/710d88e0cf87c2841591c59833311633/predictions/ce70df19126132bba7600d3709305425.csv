While it is mentioned that the paper utilizes tool support, it is explicitly stated that there is no tool support available [3][5][6][9]. This inconsistency suggests that, despite the mention of tool support in the context of the research, it is ultimately not accessible for use [1][7]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the paper does not make its tool support available.

1. **Technical Experiment** - This method is recognized as a significant evaluation technique within the study.
2. **Controlled Experiment** - Another method included in the evaluation process.
3. **Argumentation** - This method is also part of the evaluation framework.
4. **Assessment** - The evaluation of the first research object is characterized by the absence of a guideline.

The evaluation encompasses various properties, including:
- Functional Suitability
- Product Quality
- Quality in Use
- Accuracy
- Quality of Method

These properties reflect a comprehensive approach to evaluating the collaborative design process, indicating a thorough assessment of both the methods and the outcomes associated with the research [2][4][6][9].

- In **2017**, his paper titled ""Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks"" contributed to **two research objects** [9].
  
- In **2019**, he authored two papers: 
  - ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study,"" which investigated **two research objects**: 'Architecture Extraction' and 'Architecture Analysis Method' [3].
  - ""From a Monolith to a Microservices Architecture: An Approach Based on Transactional Contexts,"" which also involved **one research object**, although the specifics are not detailed [7].

- In **2020**, he investigated **two research objects** in multiple papers:
  - One paper focused on an architecture design method and evaluation [8].
  - Another paper, ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns,"" contributed to **two research objects** related to 'Architecture Pattern' and 'Performance Efficiency' as well as 'Architecture Analysis Method' and 'Functional Suitability' [5].
  - Additionally, he authored ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns,"" which contributed to an architecture optimization method [6].

- In **2021**, he investigated **two research objects**: one related to architectural aspects and the other to evaluation [1].

In summary, the number of research objects investigated by António Silva varies by year, with two research objects in 2017, two in 2019, two in 2020, and two in 2021. However, the exact total number of research objects across all years is not explicitly stated in the provided texts.

Some studies indicate that they utilize input data, but the status of this data varies. For instance, one study confirms the use of input data characterized as true, yet it is noted that this data is not available [3]. Another paper states that it does not use input data at all, while a different one confirms the use of input data that is available and true [7]. 

Additionally, there are instances where input data is reported as false and not available [2][9]. Overall, it can be inferred that there is at least one paper that has not used input data compared to one that has made its input data available [7]. However, the texts do not provide explicit information on the total number of papers that have not used input data versus those that have made their input data available, leaving the overall comparison unclear [10].

1. The study titled ""ADOOPLA - Combining Product-Line- and Product-Level Criteria in Multi-objective Optimization of Product Line Architectures"" explicitly notes that for Evidence 2, there is no input data available, indicating that no input data was used in this context [2].

2. Additionally, the ACE project, which focuses on the easy deployment of field optimization experiments, contributes to the Architecture Optimization Method. It is stated that the evidence related to this project utilizes input data characterized by the absence of any specific input data requirements, suggesting that no input data was used in this context [10].

3. Furthermore, the study on semi-automatic feedback for improving architecture conformance to microservice patterns and practices includes a contribution identified as Evidence 2, which utilizes input data classified as false, indicating that no input data was effectively used in that context. However, this does not directly link to the Architecture Optimization Method [8].

While these studies mention the Architecture Optimization Method, they provide evidence that no input data was used in specific contexts.

1. **Architectural Patterns**: This includes patterns for cross-domain personalized automotive functions and architectures for decentralized, collaborative, and autonomous robots [1][6]. 

2. **Architectural Assumptions**: Evaluated through methods such as questionnaires and interviews, this object focuses on properties like satisfaction and quality in use [3].

3. **Architecture Description Language**: This entity is part of the evaluation process, which assesses properties such as functional suitability and product quality [2].

4. **Microservice Architecture**: Research in this area includes the evaluation of microservice boundaries and resiliency patterns, focusing on properties like effectiveness and product quality [8][9].

5. **Architectural Debt**: This involves identifying and prioritizing architectural debt through architectural smells, with evaluations focusing on effectiveness and product quality [9].

6. **Evaluation Properties**: Common properties evaluated across these research objects include functional suitability, robustness, quality of method, performance efficiency, and product quality [10]. 

The evaluation processes are characterized by the absence of guidelines in some cases, and various methods such as controlled experiments, case studies, and questionnaires are employed to assess these research objects [4][5][7].

4. **Performance Efficiency** - Recognized as a key property in the evaluation of the first research object [6][9].
5. **Quality of Method** - Assessed as part of the evaluation process [2][9].

1. **Questionnaire** - This method evaluates properties such as context coverage and quality in use [1].
2. **Grounded Theory** - This method is used to assess various properties, including satisfaction and quality in use, and is guided by established guidelines [2][5].
3. **Focus Group** - This specific evaluation method examines properties like effectiveness and quality in use [3].
4. **Interview** - This method also evaluates properties such as context coverage, quality in use, and satisfaction, although it is characterized by a guideline marked as false [4].
5. **Technical Experiment** - This method is noted in studies related to improving architecture conformance to microservice patterns and practices [7].
6. **Field Experiment** - Identified as another evaluation method, it examines properties such as effectiveness, quality in use, and satisfaction, supported by established guidelines [10].
7. **Case Study** - This method evaluates properties including accuracy and quality of method, with a guideline indicating a false outcome [9].
8. **Data Science** - This method is significant in evaluating effectiveness and quality in use, although it is characterized by the absence of a guideline [6].

Overall, the evaluation processes in Zdun's work encompass a variety of properties, including effectiveness, quality in use, satisfaction, accuracy, and context coverage, reflecting a comprehensive approach to Architecture Decision Making.

Additionally, a Controlled Experiment is mentioned as another evaluation method, but it is not explicitly linked to the property Efficiency [1]. Other sources also identify the Controlled Experiment and Technical Experiment as methods used, but they do not specify the total number of different evaluation methods applied specifically to the property Efficiency [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Therefore, while two methods are clearly identified, the exact total number of different evaluation methods remains unspecified in the provided texts.

However, specific research objects to which no evaluation method has been applied are not explicitly detailed in the provided texts. Notably, the Architecture Optimization Method is identified as a research object that has been investigated without an evaluation method being applied [5]. Additionally, there are indications that some research objects, such as those characterized by the absence of guidelines, may also fall into this category, but they are not clearly specified [8][9]. Overall, while several research objects are evaluated, the texts do not provide a comprehensive list of those that lack evaluation methods.
