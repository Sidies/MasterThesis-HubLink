The following year, in 2018, the study ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" also involved two research objects [6]. 

In 2019, the paper ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study"" examined two research objects [2]. In 2020, António Silva's works included ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems,"" which investigated two research objects [3], and ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns,"" contributing to one research object [5]. Additionally, the study ""Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation"" also involved two research objects [7]. 

In 2021, the paper ""ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns"" focused on two research objects [4], and ""Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors"" contributed to two research objects as well [8]. 

Overall, while several papers consistently involved two research objects, the total number of research objects investigated by António Silva per publication year is not explicitly detailed in the texts provided.

Specifically, the paper titled ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring"" confirms that no input data was utilized in its context [3]. Additionally, the study ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach"" suggests that while evidence indicates the utilization of input data, it is characterized by the absence of specific attributes, inferring that no input data was effectively used [6]. Furthermore, the ACE project, which focuses on field optimization experiments, also indicates that the evidence utilizes input data that lacks specific requirements, suggesting that no input data was used in relation to the architecture optimization method [10]. 

In contrast, other studies, such as ""ADOOPLA - Combining Product-Line- and Product-Level Criteria in Multi-objective Optimization of Product Line Architectures,"" mention the presence of input data but also state that it is not available for certain evidence [2]. Similarly, other papers discuss scenarios where input data is mentioned but not effectively utilized [4][8]. Overall, the papers that explicitly confirm the absence of input data in the context of the Architecture Optimization Method are [3], [6], and [10].

Key properties identified across different studies are:

1. **Product Quality** - This property is frequently mentioned as a critical aspect of evaluation in multiple contexts [2][3][5][7][8][9].
2. **Quality in Use** - Evaluated in several studies, this property reflects the effectiveness of the product in real-world scenarios [1][4][5][7].
3. **Functional Suitability** - Identified as a significant property, it often includes sub-properties that further detail its evaluation [3][6][8][9].
4. **Performance Efficiency** - This property is assessed in relation to how well the system performs under various conditions [1][3].
5. **Maintainability** - Highlighted as an important property, particularly in the context of software evolution [2].
6. **Effectiveness** - This property is evaluated to determine how well the system meets its intended purpose [4][7].
7. **Quality of Method** - This property assesses the methodologies used in the evaluation process [1][9][10].
8. **Accuracy** - Mentioned as a sub-property, it focuses on the precision of the evaluations conducted [9][10].

Overall, these evaluations are characterized by the absence of a formal guideline, which is noted across the studies as a significant aspect of their findings [2][4][5][6][8].

1. **Grounded Theory** - Used in works such as ""Guiding Architectural Decision Making on Service Mesh Based Microservice Architectures"" and ""Assessing Architecture Conformance to Coupling-Related Patterns and Practices in Microservices,"" focusing on properties like satisfaction, quality in use, accuracy, and quality of method [1][4].

2. **Focus Group** - This method is employed to evaluate properties such as effectiveness and quality in use [2].

3. **Questionnaire** - This method is noted for examining properties including functional suitability, context coverage, and quality in use [3][5].

4. **Technical Experiment** - Identified as a method for assessing the first research object, characterized by the absence of guidelines [6].

5. **Field Experiment** - This method is used to evaluate properties such as effectiveness, quality in use, and satisfaction, supported by established guidelines [9].

6. **Interview** - This method is explicitly mentioned, focusing on properties like context coverage, quality in use, and satisfaction, although it is characterized by a guideline marked as false [7].

7. **Data Science** - Employed in the study ""Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events,"" focusing on effectiveness and quality in use, also characterized by the absence of a guideline [8].

8. **Case Study** - This method examines properties such as accuracy and quality of method, with a guideline indicating a false outcome [10].

Overall, the evaluation methods utilized by Uwe Zdun encompass a range of qualitative and quantitative approaches, each focusing on various properties relevant to Architecture Decision Making.

In contrast, in the year 2018, it is also referenced in studies like ""Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study"" and ""A Platform for the Automated Provisioning of Architecture Information for Large-Scale Service-Oriented Software Systems"" [2][3]. However, there is no specific information available regarding the frequency of investigation of Architecture Extraction in papers published in 2018 compared to those in 2020. Thus, while it is acknowledged in both years, the comparative frequency of its investigation remains unclear.

In 2018, several papers were published, including ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" [1], ""Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study"" [2], and ""A platform for the automated provisioning of architecture information for large-scale service-oriented software systems"" [3]. However, there is no information available regarding any papers on Architecture Extraction published in 2020 during that year.

In 2020, two publications were noted: ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" [5] and ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" [6]. Additionally, one of the 2020 publications discusses the transition from a monolithic architecture style to a microservice architecture through a semi-automatic approach [7]. 

Overall, while there are multiple papers from 2018, the information regarding papers published in 2020 is limited to the two mentioned, with no papers specifically identified as investigating Architecture Extraction in 2018.
