Several studies referenced indicate that while tool support is utilized in various contexts, it is explicitly stated that this tool support is not available. For instance, the papers 'Enforcing Architectural Security Decisions' [1], 'Predicting the Performance of Privacy-Preserving Data Analytics Using Architecture Modelling and Simulation' [2], and 'An Architectural View for Data Protection by Design' [3] all confirm the use of tool support but also note its unavailability. 

Moreover, the study 'Flaws in Flows: Unveiling Design Flaws via Information Flow Analysis' [6] presents similar contradictions, stating that tool support is both utilized and unavailable. Additionally, the work on component-based refinement and verification of information-flow security policies [7] shows conflicting evidence regarding tool support availability. 

Overall, the information suggests that there is uncertainty about whether the paper provides available tool support, as multiple sources indicate both the presence and absence of such support. Therefore, it remains unclear if the paper makes its tool support available.

This study is characterized by its true evaluation research methodology, contributing significantly to the field of evaluation research [1][2]. 

In contrast, the paper 'Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures' also utilizes a comprehensive evaluation process, with one of its key methods being a technical experiment [2]. 

In summary, the evaluation methods differ between the two papers: the first employs a controlled experiment, while the second utilizes a technical experiment.

Notably, the paper titled ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring"" explicitly states that no input data was used in the context of this research object [4]. Additionally, the paper ""InMap: Automated Interactive Code-to-Architecture Mapping Recommendations"" also indicates that no input data was utilized [7]. Furthermore, the study ""A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures"" mentions that no input data was used in relation to Evidence 2, which characterizes the input data as lacking specific data [9]. 

In contrast, other studies related to the Architecture Optimization Method, such as those discussing semi-automatic feedback for architecture conformance and optimizing architectures for performance, cost, and security, indicate the use of input data, thus not aligning with the criteria of having no input data [5][6].

This lack of information is consistent across multiple sources, including studies on application programming interfaces, guidelines for improving architecture descriptions, and evaluations of service-based software systems in air-gapped environments.

1. **Grounded Theory** - Used in the study ""Guiding Architectural Decision Making on Service Mesh Based Microservice Architectures"" and ""Assessing Architecture Conformance to Coupling-Related Patterns and Practices in Microservices"" [1][8].
2. **Focus Group** - Identified as an evaluation method associated with the evaluation of the first research object [2].
3. **Questionnaire** - Employed as an evaluation method, focusing on properties such as functional suitability, context coverage, and quality in use [4][5].
4. **Field Experiment** - Noted as one of the evaluation methods used in the evaluation process [6].
5. **Interview** - Explicitly mentioned as an evaluation method [7].
6. **Technical Experiment** - Recognized as a method used in the assessment of the first research object [9].
7. **Case Study** - Identified as another evaluation method applied [10].

The evaluations encompass various properties, including effectiveness, quality in use, satisfaction, context coverage, functional suitability, accuracy, and product quality. Some evaluations are characterized by established guidelines, while others indicate a false evaluation status or the absence of guidelines [6][7][9][10].

In 2018, it is referenced in a platform for automated provisioning of architecture information for large-scale service-oriented software systems, as well as in the study titled ""Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study"" [1][3]. However, there is no information available regarding the frequency of its investigation in papers published in 2020.

In 2020, Architecture Extraction is discussed in the publication ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" and in the study ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" [2][5]. Despite these mentions, the provided texts do not specify how often Architecture Extraction is investigated in papers from 2018 compared to those from 2020, leaving a gap in the comparative analysis of its investigation across these two years [4].

The research objects mentioned include:

1. Architecture Design Method, categorized as a research object entity, which has undergone evaluation but lacks a guideline [2].
2. Architecture Optimization Method, which is part of a research object list and does not have an evaluation method explicitly mentioned [3].
3. Architectural aspects related to the study on identifying domain-based cyclic dependencies, which is evaluated but also lacks a guideline [4].
4. Architectural decision making, which is part of a broader research object list and has been evaluated through a process that includes properties like 'Effectiveness' and 'Quality in Use,' but again, this evaluation is characterized by the absence of a guideline [5].
5. Architecture Evolution, which is noted to have undergone an evaluation process, indicating that evaluation methods have been applied to it [6].

Overall, while various research objects have been investigated, the texts do not specify any that have been investigated without the application of an evaluation method.

One such paper is titled ""Designing Robust Software Systems through Parametric Markov Chain Synthesis."" Although it contributes to the architecture design method, it is noted that the evidence presented utilizes input data, which is characterized as not available, suggesting that the research may not have used input data in its evaluation [1].

Another relevant study is ""Mapping Features to Source Code through Product Line Architecture: Traceability and Conformance."" This research also contributes to the architecture design method; however, there is no explicit information provided regarding whether it has used input data or not [2].

Additionally, a paper focused on the synthesis and quantitative verification of tradeoff spaces for families of software systems was published in 2017. This paper contributes to the architecture design method and is supported by evidence indicating that the input data is not available [3]. 

In summary, while some papers contribute to the architecture design method, the clarity on the use of input data varies, with one explicitly indicating that input data is not available.

These include ""Architectural Patterns for Cross-Domain Personalised Automotive Functions"" [1], ""The Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games"" [2], ""Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis"" [3], ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" [4], and ""DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions"" [5]. 

However, the texts do not provide specific information regarding which paper class is most frequently applied to papers published in 2020 that utilize the Benchmark evaluation method. Thus, while we have multiple examples of papers classified under Paper Class 2, the exact frequency of this classification among all relevant papers remains unspecified.
