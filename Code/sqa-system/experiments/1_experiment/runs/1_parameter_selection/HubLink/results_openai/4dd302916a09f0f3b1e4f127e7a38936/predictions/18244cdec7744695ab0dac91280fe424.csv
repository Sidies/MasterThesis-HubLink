Several sources indicate that while tool support is utilized in various contexts, it is explicitly noted that such support is not available. For instance, one study mentions that tool support is confirmed to be available, while another states that there is no tool support available [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. This inconsistency leads to uncertainty about whether the tool support for the paper is indeed accessible.

Additionally, the evaluation encompasses various properties such as functional suitability, quality in use, product quality, satisfaction, efficiency, and context coverage. It is important to note that the evaluation is characterized by the absence of a guideline [2][7]. Furthermore, interviews are also mentioned as an evaluation method, contributing to the assessment of quality in use, satisfaction, and context coverage, with the evaluation process marked as having no guideline [8]. Overall, the evaluation methods and properties reflect a comprehensive approach to assessing collaborative design within the paper [9].

Specifically, one paper utilizes input data characterized as true, but this data is not available [5]. Another paper indicates that it utilizes input data, but this data is classified as false and also not available [2][7]. Additionally, there is evidence of a paper that utilizes input data, which is confirmed to be available, yet it is also noted that this input data is false [4]. 

Overall, while there are papers that have utilized input data, the texts do not provide a clear comparison of the total number of papers that have not used input data versus those that have made their input data available. Therefore, it remains unclear how many papers have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available, as the information is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources [1][3][6][8][9][10].

Notably, the paper titled ""A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures"" states that no input data was utilized in its context, as indicated by the absence of any specific data [3]. Additionally, the paper ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring"" also confirms that no input data was used in its investigation of the Architecture Optimization Method [5]. Furthermore, the paper ""InMap: Automated Interactive Code-to-Architecture Mapping Recommendations"" explicitly mentions that no input data was used in its exploration of this research object [9]. 

In contrast, other papers discussing the Architecture Optimization Method, such as ""An Architecture-Driven Adaptation Approach for Big Data Cyber Security Analytics"" and studies related to performance prediction and architecture conformance, indicate that input data was utilized or available [1][2][4][6][7][8][10]. Thus, the papers that specifically investigate the Architecture Optimization Method while indicating no input data was used are [3], [5], and [9].

1. **Grounded Theory** - Used in the context of service mesh-based microservice architectures, focusing on properties such as satisfaction and quality in use [1].
2. **Interviews** - This method examines properties like context coverage, quality in use, and satisfaction, with a guideline marked as false [2].
3. **Questionnaires** - Employed to assess properties including functional suitability, context coverage, and quality in use [3][7].
4. **Focus Groups** - Identified as an evaluation method associated with the first research object [5].
5. **Field Experiments** - This method evaluates properties such as effectiveness, quality in use, satisfaction, and context coverage, guided by established guidelines [6].
6. **Technical Experiments** - Noted as part of the assessment process, although characterized by a false evaluation status [9].
7. **Case Studies** - Used to examine properties like accuracy and quality of method, with a guideline indicating a false outcome [8].
8. **Data Science** - Identified in a qualitative multi-method study, focusing on effectiveness and quality in use, but noted to lack a guideline [10].

Overall, these methods reflect a structured approach to evaluating architecture decisions, encompassing a range of properties that contribute to understanding and improving architecture decision-making processes.

These methods are named Technical Experiment, Questionnaire, and Controlled Experiment [1]. However, some sources indicate that there may be at least two other methods mentioned, specifically Controlled Experiment and Argumentation, but do not confirm if there are additional methods used [5]. Overall, while multiple evaluation methods are referenced across various studies, the exact total number of different evaluation methods specifically applied to evaluate the property Efficiency is not explicitly stated in the provided texts [2][3][4][6][7][8][9][10].

Additionally, a study titled ""Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study"" was published in the same year, but it does not specifically address Architecture Extraction [2]. 

In contrast, in the publication year 2020, several studies explore related themes, such as the transition from a monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture through a semi-automatic approach [1], and the analysis of microservice resiliency patterns [3]. Another publication titled ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" also appeared in 2020 [4]. However, none of these 2020 publications provide information regarding the investigation of Architecture Extraction.

Overall, while Architecture Extraction is mentioned in 2018, there is no evidence of its investigation in the papers published in 2020.

Notably, one research object is identified as the ""Architecture Design Method,"" while another is referred to as the ""Architecture Optimization Method."" However, it is unclear whether any evaluation methods have been applied to these specific research objects [1][2]. 

Additionally, the research object ""Architecture Evolution"" is mentioned, but it is indicated that at least one research object, referred to as ""First Research Object 2,"" has undergone an evaluation process, suggesting that evaluation methods have been applied to it [3]. 

In another study, two research objects are identified, with the first undergoing a comprehensive evaluation process. The second research object, which focuses on architectural aspects, is noted to lack a guideline associated with it, indicating that it has been investigated but no evaluation method has been applied [4]. 

Furthermore, the study on architectural decision making contributes to a research object that is also evaluated, but again, there is no explicit mention of any research objects investigated by Uwe Zdun that lack evaluation methods [5][6]. 

In summary, while several research objects are identified, the texts do not clearly specify which research objects have not been evaluated.

The technical experiment is also noted as a significant evaluation method, particularly in studies related to microservice patterns.
