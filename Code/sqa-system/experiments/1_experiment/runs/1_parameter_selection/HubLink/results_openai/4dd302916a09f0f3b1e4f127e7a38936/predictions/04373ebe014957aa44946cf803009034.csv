On one hand, it is indicated that the paper utilizes tool support, but it is also noted that there is no tool support available [3]. Conversely, another source confirms that tool support is indeed available and verified to be true [3]. This inconsistency suggests that it is unclear whether the tool support is actually made available in the context of this paper [21]. Thus, the overall conclusion is that there are contradictory statements about the availability of tool support for the paper.

The evaluation encompasses various properties such as functional suitability, product quality, quality in use, and satisfaction. Additionally, it is noted that one evaluation is characterized by the absence of a guideline, while another confirms the presence of a guideline [1][2][6][22].

In contrast, the paper 'Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures' utilizes a technical experiment as a notable evaluation method [4]. While both papers incorporate comprehensive evaluation processes, the specific details of the evaluation methods used in the latter paper are not explicitly provided in the texts [1][2][3][5][6]. Thus, the primary distinction lies in the type of experiments employed: a controlled experiment in the first paper and a technical experiment in the second.

- **2017**: Two research objects were investigated in the paper titled ""Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks"" [10]. Additionally, the paper ""Accurate Analysis of Quality Properties of Software with Observation-Based Markov Chain Refinement"" also contributed to a research object [11]. However, the total number of distinct research objects for this year is not explicitly stated.

- **2018**: The paper ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" contributed to two research objects [13]. Again, the total number of distinct research objects for this year is not explicitly stated.

- **2019**: Multiple papers contributed to two research objects each, including ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study"" [4], ""How Developers Discuss Architecture Smells? An Exploratory Study on Stack Overflow"" [14], and ""On Interfaces to Support Agile Architecting in Automotive: An Exploratory Case Study"" [18]. However, the total number of distinct research objects for this year is not explicitly stated.

- **2020**: Several papers, including ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" [1], ""Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation"" [5], and ""Anatomy, Concept, and Design Space of Blockchain Networks"" [22], each investigated two research objects. The paper ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns"" contributed to one research object [6]. The total number of distinct research objects for this year is not explicitly stated.

- **2021**: Papers such as ""ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns"" [2], ""Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors"" [8], and ""Optimized Dependency Weights in Source Code Clustering"" [20] each contributed to two research objects. The paper ""Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution"" contributed to one research object [16]. The total number of distinct research objects for this year is not explicitly stated.

In summary, while multiple papers across different years contributed to two research objects each, the exact total number of distinct research objects investigated by António Silva per publication year is not provided in the texts.

Specifically, one paper has made its input data available, while another has not made its input data available [2]. Additionally, there are instances where papers have utilized input data that is characterized as false or not available [1][6][10][21]. 

In summary, at least one paper has not used input data, as indicated by its characterization of the absence of any specific input data [18][24]. Conversely, there is at least one paper that has made its input data available and confirmed it to be true [14][21]. However, the exact counts of papers that have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available are not explicitly provided in the texts [3][16][27]. Thus, while we can identify instances of both categories, a precise numerical comparison remains unclear.

Notably, the paper titled ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns"" explicitly states that no input data was used, as characterized by evidence confirming its absence [23]. Additionally, the study on semi-automatic feedback for improving architecture conformance to microservice patterns mentions that the input data used is classified as false, indicating that no input data was utilized [7]. 

Furthermore, the study titled ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach"" suggests that while input data is mentioned, it is characterized by the absence of specific attributes, implying that no valid input data was used in this context [8]. Similarly, the research on the IoT Architectural Self-adaptation Framework indicates that the framework utilizes input data characterized as having no associated data, resulting in a false condition, which suggests that no input data was used [14].

In summary, the studies that investigate the Architecture Optimization Method and indicate that no input data was used include the paper on monolith migration complexity [23], the semi-automatic feedback study [7], and the IoT architectural framework [14].

This classification is supported by multiple sources, including papers such as ""An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots"" [1], ""A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing"" [2], and ""Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context"" [9]. However, it is important to note that while many papers are classified under Paper Class 2, the specific paper class that papers are most frequently classified as when they investigate Reliability is not explicitly stated in the provided texts. Nonetheless, the trend suggests that evaluation research is a common classification for such investigations, as indicated by the contributions from various studies [19].

However, the provided texts do not specify how frequently each property is evaluated in comparison to the other. Multiple studies and evaluations mention both properties, but none offer explicit information regarding their relative evaluation frequencies. For instance, while studies on data-centric communication, microservice architectures, and service-oriented approaches include both Satisfaction and Context Coverage, they do not clarify the frequency of their evaluations [1][2][4][8][9][10][12][14][18]. Consequently, a direct comparison of the evaluation frequency between Satisfaction and Context Coverage in the context of Architecture Evolution remains unaddressed in the available literature [3][5][6][11][16][17][19][20].

The key properties identified across multiple studies are:

1. **Product Quality** - This property is frequently mentioned as a central focus in the evaluations [1][3][4][5][10][21][25].
2. **Quality in Use** - This property is consistently highlighted, indicating its importance in assessing how well the product performs in real-world scenarios [4][8][12][19][24][29].
3. **Functional Suitability** - Identified as a significant property, often associated with sub-properties that further define its scope [3][10][16][21][27].
4. **Performance Efficiency** - This property is evaluated to understand how effectively the system performs under various conditions [1][10][21][23][30].
5. **Effectiveness** - This property assesses the overall success of the methods and products in achieving their intended outcomes [7][19][20][24].
6. **Satisfaction** - This property reflects user satisfaction and is often linked to the quality of the user experience [9][13][28][29].
7. **Accuracy** - This property, sometimes considered a sub-property, focuses on the precision of the methods used in the evaluation [2][11][15][30].
8. **Quality of Method** - This property evaluates the robustness and reliability of the methods employed in the research [1][11][27].

Additionally, it is noted that all these evaluations are characterized by the absence of a formal guideline, which is marked as false in the context of the studies [3][4][10][21][27]. This lack of adherence to a guideline suggests a more exploratory approach to evaluating Technical Debt, allowing for a broader range of properties to be assessed.

1. **Questionnaire** - This method is used to assess properties such as functional suitability and quality in use [1][3][17].
2. **Focus Group** - This method focuses on properties including effectiveness and quality in use [2][25].
3. **Grounded Theory** - Applied in several contexts, this method evaluates properties such as satisfaction, accuracy, and quality of method [4][5][6].
4. **Case Study** - This method examines properties like effectiveness and quality in use [7][10][23].
5. **Technical Experiment** - This method is noted for evaluating properties such as accuracy and quality of method [11][14][21][27].
6. **Controlled Experiment** - This method is categorized under evaluation methods and assesses properties like functional suitability and quality in use [9][24][29].
7. **Interview** - This method evaluates properties including satisfaction and quality in use [8][16][22].
8. **Data Science** - Identified as a significant evaluation method, focusing on effectiveness and quality in use [12][26].
9. **Benchmark** - This method is part of the evaluation process, assessing performance efficiency and quality of method [21].
10. **Argumentation** - This method is also included in the evaluation process, focusing on properties such as functional suitability and quality in use [29][30].

The evaluations often encompass various properties, including effectiveness, quality in use, satisfaction, accuracy, and functional suitability. Additionally, some evaluations are characterized by the absence of guidelines, which may affect the interpretation of results [11][12][19][21].

However, there is no information provided regarding the investigation of architecture extraction in papers published in the year 2020 [1][3][5].

In contrast, the year 2020 saw the publication of works like ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" and ""Incremental Calibration of Architectural Performance Models with Parametric Dependencies,"" but again, there is no information regarding the investigation of architecture extraction in papers published in 2018 [2][7].

Overall, a direct comparison between the frequency of investigation of architecture extraction in papers from 2018 and 2020 cannot be made, as there is a lack of information on the topic for both years [2][8].

Notably, the second research object related to architectural aspects, as mentioned in the study on identifying domain-based cyclic dependencies in microservice APIs, is characterized by the absence of a guideline, indicating that no evaluation method has been applied [4]. Additionally, the Architecture Optimization Method, which is part of a research object list, is also noted to lack an evaluation method, as it is evaluated through a method marked as false [7]. 

Furthermore, the first research object associated with the Unlimited Rulebook is evaluated without a guideline, suggesting that it too may not have a proper evaluation method applied [11]. Lastly, the first research object related to the study on architectural knowledge in issue tracking systems does not provide specific information about any evaluation methods applied, indicating a potential lack of evaluation [16]. 

Overall, while specific research objects are mentioned, the texts do not provide a comprehensive list of all research objects investigated by Uwe Zdun that lack evaluation methods.
