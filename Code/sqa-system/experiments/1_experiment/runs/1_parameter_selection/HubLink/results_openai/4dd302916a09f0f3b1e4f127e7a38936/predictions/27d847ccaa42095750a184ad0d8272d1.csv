Additionally, this paper employs a structured evaluation process that encompasses a comprehensive list of methods, including a technical experiment [2]. 

In contrast, the paper titled 'Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures' utilizes a comprehensive evaluation process as well, with a notable evaluation method identified as a technical experiment [2]. However, specific details regarding the evaluation methods used in this second paper are not provided in the texts [3]. 

In summary, while both papers employ structured evaluation processes, the first paper emphasizes a controlled experiment alongside argumentation, whereas the second paper is characterized by the use of a technical experiment.

- **2017**: Two research objects were investigated in the paper titled ""Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks"" and in ""Accurate Analysis of Quality Properties of Software with Observation-Based Markov Chain Refinement"" [12][13].

- **2018**: The paper ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" contributed to two research objects [5].

- **2019**: The study ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study"" investigated two research objects, and ""How Developers Discuss Architecture Smells? An Exploratory Study on Stack Overflow"" also involved one research object [1][15]. 

- **2020**: The paper ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns"" contributed to one research object, while ""Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation"" and ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" each included two research objects [2][4][7].

- **2021**: Two research objects were investigated in both ""ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns"" and ""Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors"" [3][8].

In summary, while the exact number of research objects investigated by António Silva per publication year is not consistently specified across all texts, it is clear that he has contributed to multiple research objects in each of the years mentioned.

Notably, the paper titled ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring"" confirms that no input data was utilized in the context of Evidence 2, which is characterized as not being used [4]. Similarly, the study ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns"" also indicates that no input data was used, as evidenced by the statement that the evidence utilizes input data characterized by the absence of any input data [14]. 

Additionally, the study titled ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach"" suggests that while Evidence 2 utilizes input data, it indicates a false status regarding its presence, implying that no valid input data was used in this context [8]. Furthermore, the IoT Architectural Self-adaptation Framework contributes to the Architecture Optimization Method, noting that the framework utilizes input data characterized as having no associated data, resulting in a false condition, which indicates that no input data was effectively used [16]. 

Overall, these studies collectively highlight the investigation of the Architecture Optimization Method while confirming the absence of effective input data usage.

These properties are:

1. **Product Quality** - This property is frequently mentioned across various studies as a key focus in the evaluation of Technical Debt [1][3][7][11][17].
2. **Quality in Use** - Identified as an important property in multiple evaluations, it assesses how well the product meets user needs [3][10][12][19].
3. **Functional Suitability** - This property evaluates whether the product fulfills its intended purpose and is often broken down into sub-properties [3][7][11][17].
4. **Performance Efficiency** - Highlighted as a significant aspect, this property assesses how well the product performs under various conditions [1][14][17][20].
5. **Satisfaction** - This property, which may include sub-properties, evaluates user satisfaction with the product [15][19].
6. **Accuracy** - Noted as a sub-property in some evaluations, it focuses on the correctness of the methods and results [2][18][20].
7. **Quality of Method** - This property assesses the robustness and appropriateness of the methods used in the evaluation process [1][11][20].
8. **Effectiveness** - This property evaluates how effectively the product achieves its goals [5][16].

These properties are assessed in various contexts, and the evaluations are characterized by the absence of established guidelines, indicating a need for more structured approaches in future research.

1. **Focus Group** - This method emphasizes properties such as effectiveness and quality in use [1].
2. **Questionnaire** - This method assesses context coverage and quality in use [2][4].
3. **Grounded Theory** - Utilized in multiple studies, this method evaluates properties like satisfaction and quality in use [3][6][9].
4. **Interview** - This method examines properties including effectiveness, quality in use, and satisfaction [7][14].
5. **Case Study** - This method is characterized by the absence of guidelines and evaluates properties such as accuracy and quality of method [8][10].
6. **Field Experiment** - This method focuses on effectiveness, quality in use, and satisfaction, guided by established guidelines [11].
7. **Technical Experiment** - This method is noted for evaluating performance efficiency and quality of method, often without guidelines [12][17][19][20].
8. **Controlled Experiment** - Applied in specific studies, this method is used to assess various properties [13].

Overall, the evaluation processes across these methods are characterized by a mix of established guidelines and instances where guidelines are absent, impacting the validity and outcomes of the evaluations.

However, there is no information provided regarding the frequency of investigation of Architecture Extraction in papers published in 2020. 

In 2020, studies such as ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns,"" ""Incremental Calibration of Architectural Performance Models with Parametric Dependencies,"" and ""Empowering SysML-Based Software Architecture Description with Formal Verification: From SysADL to CSP"" were published, but again, there is no information regarding the investigation of Architecture Extraction in papers from 2018. 

Overall, while there are multiple references to Architecture Extraction in 2018, no comparative analysis or frequency data is available for the years 2018 and 2020 based on the provided texts. Therefore, a direct comparison between the two years cannot be made. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]

However, it is noted that certain research objects, such as the Architecture Optimization Method and aspects of First Research Object 2, may not have undergone evaluation methods, as indicated by the absence of guidelines associated with them [4][13]. Additionally, while various research objects like Architecture Evolution and architecture patterns are mentioned, there is no clear indication that they lack evaluation methods [9][10]. Overall, the texts suggest that while some research objects are evaluated, specific instances of those that have not been evaluated remain unspecified [1][2][3][5][6][7][11][12][14][15].

The most frequently mentioned methods are the case study, technical experiment, questionnaire, and interview technique. Specifically, the case study is identified as a prominent evaluation method [1][2][4][10][14][19]. Additionally, the technical experiment is also highlighted as a significant method used in this context [6][12][17][20]. Other methods such as the questionnaire and interview technique are mentioned as well, but the texts do not definitively state which of these methods is applied the most overall [3][7][9][15][18].

1. The paper titled ""Designing Robust Software Systems through Parametric Markov Chain Synthesis"" was published in 2017 and contributes to the Architecture Design Method; however, it explicitly states that it utilizes input data, thus not meeting the criteria [1].

2. ""An Architecture Framework for Modelling and Simulation of Situational-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems,"" also published in 2017, investigates the Architecture Design Method but confirms the presence of input data, which is characterized as false, disqualifying it from the criteria [2].

3. The work ""Design Criteria to Architect Continuous Experimentation for Self-Driving Vehicles,"" published in 2017, states that the design criteria utilize input data, indicating it does not meet the criteria [3].

4. ""Continuous Analysis of Collaborative Design,"" published in 2017, similarly utilizes input data, which means it does not satisfy the criteria [4].

5. The study ""Mapping Features to Source Code through Product Line Architecture: Traceability and Conformance,"" published in 2017, includes contributions to the Architecture Design Method but does not provide information on any papers that investigate this method without using input data [5].

6. Lastly, the paper ""The synthesis and quantitative verification of tradeoff spaces for families of software systems,"" while associated with the Architecture Design Method and published in 2017, contains conflicting statements regarding the use of input data, ultimately indicating that it does utilize input data [6].

In summary, all identified papers from 2017 that investigate the Architecture Design Method have utilized input data, thus none meet the specified criteria.
