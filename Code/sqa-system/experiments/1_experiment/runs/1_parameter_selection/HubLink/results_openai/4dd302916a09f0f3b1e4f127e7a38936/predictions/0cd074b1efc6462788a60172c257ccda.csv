In contrast, the paper titled 'Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures' utilizes a comprehensive evaluation process that includes a technical experiment [2]. While both papers incorporate structured evaluation methods, the specific details of the evaluation methods used in the second paper are not fully elaborated in the provided texts. Thus, the first paper is characterized by a controlled experiment and argumentation, whereas the second paper is noted for its technical experiment.

For instance, the study titled ""Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study"" employs questionnaires and interviews [2]. Another study, ""Identifying and Prioritizing Architectural Debt Through Architectural Smells: A Case Study in a Large Software Company,"" applies case studies and questionnaires [3]. Similarly, ""Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis"" also utilizes case studies and questionnaires [4]. Lastly, the Unlimited Rulebook discusses controlled experiments and argumentation but does not include Field Experiment [5], and the study on semi-automatic feedback mentions technical experiments without referencing Field Experiment [6].

Notably, the paper titled ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns"" explicitly states that no input data was utilized in the context of this research object [6]. Additionally, the paper ""EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software Architecture Refactoring"" also indicates that no input data was used [7]. 

While other papers mention the Architecture Optimization Method, they often indicate that input data was either falsely classified or not effectively utilized. For instance, in the context of the ACE project, it is noted that the evidence related to the architecture optimization method utilizes input data characterized by its absence, suggesting that no valid input data was used [4]. Similarly, other studies reference input data that is confirmed to be false or unavailable, implying that the architecture optimization method may not have effectively used input data [1][3][5][10]. 

Overall, the papers that clearly state no input data was used in relation to the Architecture Optimization Method are [6] and [7].

1. The first research object is categorized as an **Architecture Design Method**. This object is evaluated based on various properties, including **effectiveness**, **product quality**, and **compatibility** [1][4][10]. 

2. The second research object is associated with the **Architecture Analysis Method**. This object also undergoes evaluation guided by specific criteria, although no established guidelines for this evaluation are noted [5][10]. 

Additionally, other studies contribute to these research objects by focusing on aspects such as architectural patterns and methods for analyzing microservice resiliency and conformance to architectural standards [2][3][7][8]. Overall, the research objects reflect a comprehensive exploration of architectural methods and their evaluation in the context of software development.

While studies such as 'State of the Practice in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): A Case Study' and 'Migrating Towards Microservice Architectures: An Industrial Survey' mention these properties, they do not offer explicit information regarding the frequency of evaluation for Satisfaction compared to Context Coverage in the context of Architecture Evolution [1][2][3][4].

1. **Product Quality** - This property is frequently mentioned across various studies as a critical aspect of evaluation [2][5][7].
2. **Maintainability** - This property is also noted in the context of Technical Debt evaluations [2][7].
3. **Functional Suitability** - Identified as a significant property in some evaluations [3][8].
4. **Quality in Use** - This property is highlighted in multiple studies, indicating its importance in the evaluation process [4][6][9].
5. **Effectiveness** - This property is assessed in relation to the overall performance of the research object [4][9].
6. **Satisfaction** - This sub-property is related to the quality in use and is considered in some evaluations [6].
7. **Security** - This property is specifically mentioned and may include further sub-properties [5].

Overall, the evaluations of these properties are characterized by the absence of formalized guidelines, indicating a lack of standardized procedures in the assessment of Technical Debt [1][2][4][5].

1. **Grounded Theory** - Used in works such as ""Guiding Architectural Decision Making on Service Mesh Based Microservice Architectures"" and ""Assessing Architecture Conformance to Coupling-Related Patterns and Practices in Microservices,"" focusing on properties like satisfaction, quality in use, accuracy, and quality of method [1][3].

2. **Focus Group** - This method emphasizes properties such as effectiveness and quality in use [2].

3. **Case Study** - This method examines properties including accuracy and quality of method, with a guideline indicating a false outcome [4].

4. **Field Experiment** - This method assesses properties like effectiveness, quality in use, and satisfaction, supported by established guidelines [6].

5. **Interview** - This method is noted for evaluating context coverage, quality in use, and satisfaction, characterized by a guideline marked as false [7].

6. **Technical Experiment** - Identified as a method used in the assessment of the research object, with an evaluation status indicating a false outcome and an absence of guidelines [8].

7. **Questionnaire** - This method encompasses properties such as context coverage, quality in use, and functional suitability [9][10].

These diverse evaluation methods reflect a comprehensive approach to assessing various aspects of Architecture Decision Making.

It is discussed in a publication from the year 2020 titled ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" [1]. Additionally, it is mentioned in the context of the study ""Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study,"" published in 2018, which contributes to the understanding of architecture extraction [2]. Another relevant paper from 2018 is ""A Platform for the Automated Provisioning of Architecture Information for Large-Scale Service-Oriented Software Systems,"" which also addresses architecture extraction [3]. 

However, there is no information available regarding how often Architecture Extraction is investigated in papers published in 2018 compared to those published in 2020 [4].

While the first research object, architecture decision making, is evaluated through various methods, the second research object, which focuses on architectural aspects, is noted to lack a guideline for its evaluation, indicating that it has not undergone a formal evaluation method. Specifically, the second research object is identified as the Architecture Optimization Method, which has been investigated without an associated evaluation method [3][5]. However, the texts do not provide explicit details on any other research objects investigated by Uwe Zdun to which no evaluation method has been applied [1][2][4][6][7][8].

Additionally, the reference architecture for federated learning systems, FLRA, published in 2021, also utilized Data Science for its evaluation [1]. Furthermore, a publication from 2021 discussed architectural decay as a predictor of issue- and change-proneness, which included Data Science in its evaluation methods [5].

In contrast, the publication year 2021 saw works like ""Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution"" and ""Continuous API Evolution in Heterogeneous Enterprise Software Systems"" [3][4]. Nonetheless, there is also no information provided about the number of papers investigating Architecture Evolution in 2021.

Thus, the final answer is:
There is no specific information available regarding the number of papers investigating Architecture Evolution in both the publication years 2020 and 2021.
