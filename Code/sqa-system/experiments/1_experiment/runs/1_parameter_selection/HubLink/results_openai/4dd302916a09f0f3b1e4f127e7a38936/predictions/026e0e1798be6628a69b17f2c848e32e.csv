On one hand, it is indicated that the study contributes evidence that utilizes tool support; however, it is also noted that there is no tool support available [5]. Additionally, another passage states that tool support is available and confirmed to be true, further complicating the understanding of its availability [5]. Thus, the overall conclusion is that there are contradictory statements concerning the tool support in this paper.

Other studies mentioned, such as those focusing on architecture-driven adaptation for big data cyber security analytics and quantitative verification-aided machine learning, evaluate various properties but do not explicitly mention robustness [2][3]. Additionally, the evaluation of automated interactive code-to-architecture mapping recommendations also does not include robustness among its assessed properties [4]. Thus, the primary investigation of robustness is found in the first paper mentioned.

Specifically, one paper focuses on the quality evaluation of Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud application design, highlighting reliability as a significant aspect among its properties [1]. Additionally, another paper discusses an architecture-driven adaptation approach for big data cyber security analytics, where reliability is also identified as a key property [2]. 

However, neither source specifies the exact number of papers that evaluate the property of reliability. It is clear that at least one paper evaluates this property, and it appears to be a recurring focus across different contexts, but a total count of such papers is not provided. Thus, while reliability is acknowledged as an important evaluative property, the specific number of papers assessing it remains unspecified.

Specifically, while some papers claim to utilize input data, it is often noted that this data is not available or characterized by the absence of specific attributes, indicating a false status regarding its presence. For example, Evidence 2 is mentioned multiple times as utilizing input data, but it is confirmed that this data is not available [1][2][4][6][9][10]. 

This suggests that there are papers that have not made their input data available, and it can be inferred that there are at least some papers that have not used input data at all. However, the exact counts of papers that have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available are not provided in the texts [3][5][7][8]. Thus, while it is clear that there are instances of both types, the specific numbers remain unspecified.

2. Another relevant paper, ""On Cognitive Biases in Architecture Decision Making,"" also indicates that the input data is characterized as not available, supporting the notion that no input data was used [1].

3. The study ""Synchronous Reconfiguration of Distributed Embedded Applications During Operation"" suggests that no input data was used in the investigation of the Architecture Optimization Method, as it indicates that the input data is not available [9].

4. Additionally, the paper ""Architecture-Centric Support for Integrating Security Tools in a Security Orchestration Platform"" notes that the input data is not used, further confirming that the Architecture Optimization Method does not utilize any input data [10].

These papers collectively highlight the absence of input data in the context of the Architecture Optimization Method.

Specific research objects include:

1. **Architecture Analysis Method**: This object is evaluated through various properties such as accuracy, quality of the method, and product quality [1][2]. It also involves enforcing architectural security decisions [2].

2. **Design Criteria for Self-Driving Vehicles**: This research object is evaluated based on properties like context coverage and Quality in Use [3]. 

3. **First Research Object 2**: This object emphasizes performance efficiency and product quality, with evaluations focusing on these properties [4][5][6]. It also includes the Safety Analysis Method for Cooperative Driving Systems, which contributes to its evaluation [6].

4. **Architecture Decision Making**: Identified as another key research object, this area assesses properties such as effectiveness and quality in use [10].

Overall, the evaluation processes for these research objects are characterized by the absence of a guideline and involve comprehensive evaluation method lists detailing various entities and their associated properties [1][7].

The continuous analysis of collaborative design highlights Satisfaction as one of the properties under evaluation, yet it does not specify its frequency relative to Context Coverage [1]. Similarly, studies on data-centric communication and containerization for automotive software architectures mention Satisfaction as a property evaluated alongside others, but again, they do not provide details on the frequency of its evaluation compared to Context Coverage [2]. Additionally, evaluations related to technical architectures for automotive systems also include Satisfaction, but there is no clear indication of how often it is assessed in comparison to Context Coverage [3]. Overall, while Satisfaction is recognized as an important property, the frequency of its evaluation relative to Context Coverage remains unspecified in the available literature.

1. **Case Study** - This method serves as a specific example within the evaluation framework [1].
2. **Technical Experiment** - This method is also highlighted as a significant evaluation approach [2].
3. **Questionnaire** - This method is utilized to gather insights related to the evaluation process [4].
4. **Focus Group** - This method is identified as part of the evaluation entities associated with the research [8].
5. **Benchmark** - This method is included among the evaluation techniques applied [7].

The evaluation processes encompass various properties such as effectiveness, quality in use, functional suitability, product quality, performance efficiency, and accuracy [3][4][7]. However, it is noted that some evaluations may lack specific guidelines, which can affect the overall assessment [6][9].

The papers included a study on cognitive biases in architecture decision making [2], a synthesis and quantitative verification of tradeoff spaces for families of software systems [3], and an architecture description of situational aware cyber-physical systems [4]. Additionally, a paper titled 'Determination and Enforcement of Least-Privilege Architecture in Android' was published [5], along with a study on the quality evaluation of PaaS cloud application design using generated prototypes [6]. However, none of these papers provided information regarding an investigation into Technical Debt.

- In 2018, there are no papers mentioned that investigate Architecture Extraction. However, there are papers published in that year, such as ""View-Centric Context Modeling to Foster the Engineering of Cyber-Physical System Networks"" and ""Migrating Towards Microservice Architectures: An Industrial Survey,"" but they do not focus on Architecture Extraction [4][8].
  
- In 2020, several papers are noted, including ""A Complexity Metric for Microservices Architecture Migration,"" ""Data Stream Operations as First-Class Entities in Component-Based Performance Models,"" ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns,"" ""COCOS: A Scalable Architecture for Containerized Heterogeneous Systems,"" and ""Enforcing Architectural Security Decisions."" However, none of these papers specifically investigate Architecture Extraction [1][3][5][7][9].

Thus, the final distribution is:
- 2018: No papers mentioned regarding Architecture Extraction.
- 2020: No papers mentioned regarding Architecture Extraction.
