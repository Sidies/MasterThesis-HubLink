Furthermore, some papers indicate that the input data used is classified as false and not available, suggesting that there are papers that have utilized input data but have not made it available [4][5][8]. However, the texts do not provide explicit information about the total number of papers that have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available [3][6][10].

For instance, one study highlights that while it contributes to the Architecture Optimization Method, the evidence presented utilizes input data that is characterized as not being available, suggesting that no valid input data was utilized in the evaluation process [1][6][9]. Another paper discusses the Architecture Optimization Method in the context of performance prediction but confirms that the input data used is false, indicating that no valid input data was utilized [5]. Additionally, a study on optimizing architectures for performance, cost, and security mentions that although input data is utilized, it is noted that there is no input data available, further supporting the claim that the Architecture Optimization Method does not use input data [7][10]. Overall, these findings collectively indicate that the Architecture Optimization Method is investigated in contexts where no valid input data is utilized.

3. **Maintainability** - Evaluated as a crucial property, particularly in the context of the first research object [1][7].
4. **Quality in Use** - This property is highlighted in various studies as an important aspect of evaluation [3][4][6][7].
5. **Quality of Method** - Assessed in relation to the first research object, focusing on the method's effectiveness [2][9].
6. **Performance Efficiency** - Noted as a key property in the evaluation of the first research object [3][10].
7. **Effectiveness** - Evaluated as a significant property in the context of the first research object [6][7].
8. **Usability** - Identified as a property in the evaluation process of the first research object [5].

The evaluations across these studies are characterized by the absence of a guideline, which is a critical aspect noted in the evaluation processes [1][4][5][6][8][10].

1. **Focus Group** - This method emphasizes properties such as effectiveness and is characterized by a guideline deemed true [1].
2. **Questionnaire** - This method evaluates properties including functional suitability, context coverage, and quality in use [2][6].
3. **Field Experiment** - This method is part of the evaluation process, which examines properties like effectiveness, quality in use, satisfaction, and context coverage, supported by established guidelines [3].
4. **Data Science** - Identified as a significant evaluation method, it focuses on properties such as effectiveness and quality in use, although it lacks a guiding framework [4].
5. **Technical Experiment** - This method is noted in the context of assessing research objects, characterized by an absence of guidelines [5].
6. **Grounded Theory** - Used in multiple studies, this method is guided by established guidelines and evaluates properties like accuracy and quality of method [7][9].
7. **Interview** - This method is explicitly mentioned and evaluates properties such as context coverage, quality in use, and satisfaction, although it is characterized by a guideline marked as false [8].
8. **Case Study** - This method examines properties including accuracy and quality of method, with a guideline indicating a false outcome [10].

These diverse evaluation methods and properties reflect the comprehensive approach Uwe Zdun employs in his research on Architecture Decision Making.

1. Quality in Use
2. Quality of Method
3. Functional Suitability
4. Case Study
5. Architecture Analysis Method
6. Technical Experiment
7. Questionnaire
8. Interview Technique

These methods encompass a range of approaches, with ""Case Study"" being frequently mentioned across multiple sources [2][4][5][6][9]. Other methods such as ""Technical Experiment"" and ""Questionnaire"" are also noted, but they are less frequently referenced [8][10]. The inclusion of various evaluation methods reflects a comprehensive approach to assessing Architecture Evolution in Koziolek's research.

Studies from that year, such as ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns,"" ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems,"" and others, do not provide insights into the investigation of Architecture Extraction in 2018 [2][4][5].

However, several studies contribute to various research objects, some of which undergo evaluation while others do not. For instance, the study on architecture optimization methods indicates that one research object is evaluated, while another is characterized as having no evaluation method applied [6]. Additionally, while the research object related to architecture decision making is part of a broader research object list, it is also evaluated, but specific objects without evaluation methods are not mentioned [2][5]. 

Moreover, the research object identified as Architecture Description Language is noted to undergo evaluation, but again, there is no clear indication of any research objects investigated by Uwe Zdun that lack evaluation methods [7]. Overall, while various research objects are discussed, the texts do not provide specific information regarding those that have not been evaluated.

In 2018, several papers were published, including ""The platform for the automated provisioning of architecture information for large-scale service-oriented software systems"" [1], ""Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study"" [2], and ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" [3]. However, there is no information regarding any papers published in 2020 that specifically investigate Architecture Extraction.

In 2020, at least one paper titled ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" was published [8]. Additionally, another study exploring the transition from a monolithic architecture style to a microservice architecture through a semi-automatic approach was also published in 2020 [4]. Furthermore, the study ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" was published in the same year [6]. 

Overall, while there are multiple papers from 2018, the information regarding papers from 2020 is limited, with no specific mention of Architecture Extraction in that year.
