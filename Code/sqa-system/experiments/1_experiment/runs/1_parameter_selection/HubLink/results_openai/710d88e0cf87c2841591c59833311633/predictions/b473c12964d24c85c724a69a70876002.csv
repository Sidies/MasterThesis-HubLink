This method is part of a broader evaluation framework that details various entities associated with evaluation methods. Notably, the evaluation for this paper lacks a guideline [1].

In contrast, the evaluation methods applied in the paper titled ""Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures"" are not specified in the provided texts, making a direct comparison impossible [1][2][3][4]. 

Overall, while the first paper employs a technical experiment for its evaluation, the second paper does not have any documented evaluation methods available for analysis.

However, the specific number of papers that have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available is not provided in the texts. For example, studies indicate that input data is characterized as not being used in some cases, while in others, it is confirmed to be available but not utilized effectively [1][2][3][4][6][7][8][9][10].

2. The work on ""Automated Interactive Code-to-Architecture Mapping Recommendations"" also contributes to the Architecture Optimization Method and explicitly states that there is an absence of any input data used in this context [2].

3. In the study ""Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach,"" it is mentioned that Evidence 2 utilizes input data, but it indicates a false status regarding the presence of input data, suggesting that no input data was used [3].

4. The research titled ""Employment of Optimal Approximations on Apache Hadoop Checkpoint Technique for Performance Improvements"" contributes to the Architecture Optimization Method and confirms that the input data utilized is characterized by the absence of any specific input data, denoted as None, which is confirmed to be false [7].

5. Lastly, the study on workload-based clustering of coherent feature sets in microservice architectures contributes to the Architecture Optimization Method, but it notes that Evidence 2, which utilizes input data, is characterized by the absence of any specific elements, indicating that no input data was used [10].

These studies collectively highlight the investigation of the Architecture Optimization Method while indicating the lack of input data in various contexts.

1. **Grounded Theory** - This method is utilized in multiple papers, such as ""Guiding Architectural Decision Making on Service Mesh Based Microservice Architectures"" and ""Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures,"" where it evaluates properties like 'Quality in Use', 'Satisfaction', 'Quality of Method', 'Limit of Detection', and 'Accuracy' [1][2][8].

2. **Questionnaire** - This specific evaluation method is noted as part of the evaluation process, focusing on properties like Functional Suitability and Product Quality [3].

3. **Technical Experiment** - Identified as a key evaluation method, it is associated with properties such as Quality of Method, Effectiveness, Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, and Accuracy [4][10].

4. **Data Science** - This method is employed in the study ""Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events,"" focusing on properties like Effectiveness and Quality in Use [5].

5. **Interview Method** - This method is also used, evaluating properties including Functional Suitability and Product Quality [7].

6. **Focus Group** - Identified as another evaluation method, it assesses properties such as Effectiveness, Satisfaction, Quality in Use, and Context Coverage [9].

7. **Benchmark** - This method is recognized as part of the evaluation process, alongside Technical Experiment, and evaluates properties like Quality of Method, Product Quality, Performance Efficiency, and Accuracy [10].

Across these evaluations, it is noted that many lack established guidelines, indicating a need for further structure in the evaluation processes [3][4][5][6][7][9][10].

Additionally, he utilized the Technical Experiment and Argumentation methods [3]. While the texts mention various evaluation methods, including Verification, Technical Experiment, Benchmark, and Case Study, they do not specify the total number of different evaluation methods applied by David Monschein in the context of evaluating the property Efficiency [2][4][5][6][7][8]. Therefore, it is clear that multiple methods were employed, but the exact total remains unspecified.

Additionally, a platform for the automated provisioning of architecture information for large-scale service-oriented software systems was also published in 2018, further indicating the relevance of Architecture Extraction during that year [2]. 

In contrast, while the research object Architecture Extraction is mentioned in the context of papers published in 2020, such as in the study ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns,"" there is no specific information regarding its investigation in papers from that year [3][4]. Therefore, it can be concluded that Architecture Extraction was actively investigated in 2018, but there is no comparable information available for 2020.

However, there is no information provided regarding the total number of papers investigating the research object Architecture Evolution for that year [1][4]. 

In 2021, papers including ""Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution,"" ""Exploring Web Search Engines to Find Architectural Knowledge,"" and ""Continuous API Evolution in Heterogeneous Enterprise Software Systems"" were published. Nonetheless, there is no information available regarding the number of papers investigating Architecture Evolution for that year either [2][3][5]. 

Thus, the final answer is that while specific papers from both years are identified, the exact number of papers investigating Architecture Evolution in 2020 and 2021 remains unspecified.
