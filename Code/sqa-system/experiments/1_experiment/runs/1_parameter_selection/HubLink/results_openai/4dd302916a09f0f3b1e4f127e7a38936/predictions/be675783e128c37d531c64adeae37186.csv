Additionally, it encompasses an evaluation of various properties such as functional suitability, performance efficiency, and product quality [1][2]. 

In contrast, the paper titled ""Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures"" also utilizes a comprehensive evaluation process, with a notable evaluation method identified as a technical experiment. However, specific details regarding the evaluation methods used in this second paper are not provided [1][2]. 

In summary, the first paper includes a controlled experiment and a broader evaluation of properties, while the second paper primarily highlights a technical experiment without further elaboration on its evaluation methods.

- **2017**: The paper titled ""Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks"" contributes to two research objects, but the total number of research objects investigated per publication year is not explicitly stated [9].

- **2018**: In the study ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures,"" two research objects are identified. However, the specific number of research objects investigated by António Silva per publication year is not provided [7].

- **2019**: The paper ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study"" investigates two research objects, yet the overall count of research objects per publication year remains unspecified [4].

- **2020**: Multiple papers were published in this year:
  - ""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns"" contributes to one research object [1].
  - ""Butterfly Space: An Architectural Approach for Investigating Performance Issues"" includes contributions related to two research objects [2].
  - ""Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation"" investigates two research objects [5].
  - ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" also includes two research objects [6].
  
  However, the total number of research objects investigated by António Silva per publication year is not specified across these publications.

- **2021**: Two papers were published:
  - ""ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns"" investigates two research objects [3].
  - ""Identifying domain-based cyclic dependencies in microservice APIs using source code detectors"" also contributes to two research objects [10].
  
  Again, the specific number of research objects investigated per publication year is not provided.

In summary, while António Silva's papers contribute to multiple research objects across different years, the exact number of research objects investigated per publication year is not explicitly stated in the provided texts.

Specifically, one paper indicates that it utilizes input data characterized as None, marked as False, meaning it has not made its input data available. Therefore, there is one paper that has not used input data compared to one that has made its input data available [1][2]. 

However, there are conflicting statements regarding the availability and use of input data in some studies. For instance, one contribution indicates that it utilizes input data that is characterized as false and not available, while another suggests that the input data is true but also not available [3][4][6][7]. This inconsistency makes it challenging to determine the exact number of papers that have not used input data compared to those that have made their input data available [5][10]. 

In summary, while there is at least one paper that has not made its input data available and one that has, the overall clarity on the total number of papers in each category remains ambiguous due to conflicting information [8][9].

1. **Product Quality** - This property is frequently mentioned across various studies as a key aspect of evaluation [1][2][5][7][9][10].
2. **Functional Suitability** - Identified as a significant property in multiple evaluations, it reflects the ability of the system to provide functions that meet stated and implied needs [4][5][6][7][10].
3. **Quality in Use** - This property assesses the effectiveness and satisfaction of users when interacting with the system [4][7][8][9].
4. **Quality of Method** - This property evaluates the methodologies employed in the research [1][9].
5. **Performance Efficiency** - This property relates to how well the system performs its functions under various conditions [3][10].
6. **Effectiveness** - This property measures how well the system achieves its intended outcomes [7][8].
7. **Accuracy** - This property focuses on the correctness of the methods and results [1][9].

Additionally, it is noted that the evaluations across these studies do not adhere to a specific guideline, which is indicated by the designation of false outcomes in some cases [2][4][5][8][9].

1. **Focus Group**: This method evaluates properties such as effectiveness and quality in use [1].
2. **Grounded Theory**: Used in multiple contexts, this method assesses properties including satisfaction, accuracy, and quality of method [2][5].
3. **Questionnaire**: This method focuses on properties such as functional suitability, context coverage, and quality in use [3][4].
4. **Case Study**: This method examines properties like accuracy and quality of method, with some evaluations characterized by a guideline indicating a false outcome [6].
5. **Interview**: This method evaluates context coverage and quality in use, also marked by a guideline noted as false [7].
6. **Technical Experiment**: Identified as a method for assessing the first research object [8].
7. **Field Experiment**: This method is noted for its focus on effectiveness and quality in use, guided by established guidelines [10].
8. **Data Science**: This method emphasizes effectiveness and quality in use, characterized by the absence of a guideline [9].

These diverse evaluation methods and their associated properties contribute to a comprehensive understanding of Architecture Decision Making in Zdun's research.

However, there are indications of certain research objects that may fall into this category. For instance, the second research object identified in the study on semi-automatic feedback for improving architecture conformance to microservice patterns and practices is noted as the Architecture Optimization Method, which is evaluated through a method characterized as false, suggesting a lack of a formal evaluation method [6]. Additionally, in the study titled 'Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors,' the second research object is also evaluated without a proper evaluation method, as indicated by the designation of false [7]. 

Overall, while specific research objects are mentioned, the texts do not provide a comprehensive list of all research objects investigated by Uwe Zdun that lack evaluation methods [1][2][3][4][5][8].

The second paper, ""An Architecture Framework for Modelling and Simulation of Situational-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems,"" explicitly confirms that it has not used input data while exploring the Architecture Design Method [3]. 

In contrast, the paper ""Designing Robust Software Systems through Parametric Markov Chain Synthesis,"" also published in 2017, does not qualify as it is stated that it utilized input data [2]. Thus, the relevant papers that meet the criteria are the first and third ones.

In 2018, the following papers were published: ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" [1], ""Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study"" [2], and ""A Platform for the Automated Provisioning of Architecture Information for Large-Scale Service-Oriented Software Systems"" [5]. However, there is no information regarding any papers investigating Architecture Extraction published in 2020.

In 2020, the papers ""Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns"" [4], ""From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach"" [6], and ""Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems"" [8] were published. Despite this, none of these papers are reported to investigate the research object Architecture Extraction.

In summary, the distribution of papers is as follows:
- In 2018, three papers were published, but none are confirmed to investigate Architecture Extraction.
- In 2020, three papers were published, with no confirmed investigations into Architecture Extraction. 

Thus, the information regarding papers investigating Architecture Extraction is limited, with no clear findings for the year 2020.
