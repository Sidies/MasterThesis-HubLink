The HubLink Retriever and the Baseline Retrievers each expose a variety of tunable parameters that, in an ideal scenario, would be optimized via a full hyperparameter-tuning procedure using separate training and test datasets. However, we deviate from this optimal approach due to practical constraints as we found that experimenting with LLMs is both costly and time consuming. This is because repeated calls to an LLM during retrieval drastically increase overall runtime. Since the durations of multiweek experiments fall outside the scope of this master thesis, we adopt an alternative workflow we refer to as the *parameter selection process*. The goal of this process is to determine the parameter configurations that optimize the retrieval performance of the KGQA retrievers on our experiment setting while respecting the time and resource constraints of this project.

The following folders contain the configurations and results of the parameter selection process.
