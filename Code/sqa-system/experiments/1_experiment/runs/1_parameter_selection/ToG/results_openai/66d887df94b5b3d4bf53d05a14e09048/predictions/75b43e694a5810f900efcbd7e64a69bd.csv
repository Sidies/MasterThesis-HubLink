However, it is generally observed that the investigation of Technical Debt has been increasing over the years, particularly in software engineering and project management literature. To provide a precise frequency per publication year, one would typically need to conduct a literature review or search through academic databases to quantify the number of publications related to Technical Debt for each year. 

If you are looking for specific statistics or trends, I recommend checking academic databases like IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, or Google Scholar for the most recent publications and their frequency over the years.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.19,0.12,0.47,0.07,0.04,0.17,0.15,0.09,0.37,0.489,0.575,0.528,625.6517696380615,0.07875810000000004,395640,0,0.0,,0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,https://wandb.ai/kastel-sdq-meta-research/ma_mschneider_1_exp_tog_tuning_openai_deep_distributed/r/call/01964b65-24e7-77a1-8a2e-a0441cff744b,pre_retrieval_augmentation,pre_retrieval_processing,augmentation,openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1,OpenAI,gpt-4o-mini,0.0,-1,,False,retrieval_config,10,7,10,10,llm,True,False,kg_retrieval,tog,openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1_reasoningNone,OpenAI,gpt-4o-mini,0.0,-1,,orkg_merged_ecsa_icsa.json_jsonpublicationloader_limit-1,['paper_class'],['research_level'],['first_research_object'],['second_research_object'],['validity'],['evidence'],False,False,R659055,https://sandbox.orkg.org,orkg,merged_ecsa_icsa.json_jsonpublicationloader_limit-1,merged_ecsa_icsa.json,JsonPublicationLoader,-1,,4000,2,post_retrieval_processing,post_retrieval_processing,reranking,openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1,OpenAI,gpt-4o-mini,0.0,-1,,False,generation_openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1_reasoningNone,generation,openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1_reasoningNone,OpenAI,gpt-4o-mini,0.0,-1,,,How frequently is the research object Technical Debt investigated per publication year?,"The frequency with which the research object Technical Debt is investigated per publication year is as follows: it was investigated once in 2017, once in 2020, and once in 2021.","['10.1007/978-3-030-58923-3_14', '10.1007/978-3-030-58923-3_14', '10.1007/978-3-319-65831-5_4', '10.1007/978-3-319-65831-5_4', '10.1109/ICSA51549.2021.00017', '10.1109/ICSA51549.2021.00017']",,"['(R872808:Research Object Entity, Name, L1529238:Technical Debt)', '(R872607:Architectural Technical Debt: A Grounded Theory, publication year, L1528844:2020)', '(R869132:Research Object Entity, Name, L1521578:Technical Debt)', '(R869104:The Evolution of Technical Debt in the Apache Ecosystem, publication year, L1521523:2017)', '(R872632:Research Object Entity, Name, L1528881:Technical Debt)', '(R872780:Architectural Decay as Predictor of Issue- and Change-Proneness, publication year, L1529184:2021)']",clustering_strategy,R659055,Software Architecture and Design,5,How frequently per year is the research object with the name [research object name] investigated?

You may want to check academic databases like Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, or specific journals related to architecture and extraction research for detailed information on publication trends during those years.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13,0.31,0.22,0.5,0.22,0.16,0.37,0.31,0.22,0.5,0.528,0.629,0.574,648.3269658088684,0.055889100000000004,292005,0,0.0,,0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,https://wandb.ai/kastel-sdq-meta-research/ma_mschneider_1_exp_tog_tuning_openai_deep_distributed/r/call/01964baa-dc30-76c0-806a-cff9542125ec,pre_retrieval_augmentation,pre_retrieval_processing,augmentation,openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1,OpenAI,gpt-4o-mini,0.0,-1,,False,retrieval_config,10,7,10,10,llm,True,False,kg_retrieval,tog,openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1_reasoningNone,OpenAI,gpt-4o-mini,0.0,-1,,orkg_merged_ecsa_icsa.json_jsonpublicationloader_limit-1,['paper_class'],['research_level'],['first_research_object'],['second_research_object'],['validity'],['evidence'],False,False,R659055,https://sandbox.orkg.org,orkg,merged_ecsa_icsa.json_jsonpublicationloader_limit-1,merged_ecsa_icsa.json,JsonPublicationLoader,-1,,4000,2,post_retrieval_processing,post_retrieval_processing,reranking,openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1,OpenAI,gpt-4o-mini,0.0,-1,,False,generation_openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1_reasoningNone,generation,openai_gpt-4o-mini_tmp0.0_maxt-1_reasoningNone,OpenAI,gpt-4o-mini,0.0,-1,,,How are the papers that investigate the research object Architecture Extraction distributed between the publication years 2018 and 2020?,"The distribution of papers investigating the research object Architecture Extraction between 2018 and 2020 is as follows: two papers were published in 2018, one paper was published in 2019, and one paper was published in 2020.","['10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_14', '10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4_14', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00014', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00014', '10.1007/978-3-030-29983-5_17', '10.1007/978-3-030-29983-5_17', '10.1109/ICSA47634.2020.00023', '10.1109/ICSA47634.2020.00023', '10.1007/978-3-030-29983-5_5', '10.1007/978-3-030-29983-5_5']",,"['(R869680:Research Object Entity, Name, L1522761:Architecture Extraction)', '(R869648:A Platform for the Automated Provisioning of Architecture Information for Large-Scale Service-Oriented Software Systems, publication year, L1522702:2018)', '(R873887:Research Object Entity, Name, L1531437:Architecture Extraction)', '(R873855:Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study, publication year, L1531379:2018)', '(R872464:Research Object Entity, Name, L1528569:Architecture Extraction)', '(R872428:Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study, publication year, L1528508:2019)', '(R870549:Research Object Entity, Name, L1524582:Architecture Extraction)', '(R870521:From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach, publication year, L1524530:2020)', '(R874554:Research Object Entity, Name, L1532843:Architecture Extraction)', '(R874518:Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multi-level Greedy Modularity Clustering for Software Architecture Recovery, publication year, L1532779:2019)']",clustering_strategy,R659055,Software Architecture and Design,5,How are the papers that investigate the research object with the name [research object name] distributed between the publication year [year 1] and [year 2]?
