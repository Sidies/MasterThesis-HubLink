In two instances, there are conflicting descriptions: one text states that ""On Interfaces to Support Agile Architecting in Automotive: An Exploratory Case Study"" is secondary research [6] while another text classifies it as primary research; similarly, ""Guidelines for Architecting Android Apps: A Mixed-Method Empirical Study"" is at one point described as secondary research but elsewhere as primary research [10]. 

Thus, despite these conflicting descriptions in isolated cases, none of the texts unambiguously assign any paper solely to research level secondary research, and the overall explicit indication is that all papers are associated with primary research.

According to [1], ""Continuous Integration Impediments in Large-Scale Industry Projects"" is explicitly stated to be Paper Class 1 and is regarded within Evaluation Research. In parallel, [3] directly identifies ""An Architecture Framework for Modelling and Simulation of Situational-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems"" as Paper Class 1 (specifically as Validation Research). While [2] provides some ambiguity regarding the explicit designation for the first paper, the clear classifications from [1] and [3] allow us to conclude that in terms of paper class both are Paper Class 1, albeit representing different research approaches.

In every case the papers are assigned to Paper Class 1 (with additional characterizations such as “Proposal of Solution,” “Validation Research,” or “Evaluation Research”). Under the common assumption that the cited publications are by Manoj Bhat, the year‐wise distribution is summarized as follows:

• 2017  
 – One paper on “Automatic Extraction of Design Decisions from Issue Management Systems: A Machine Learning Based Approach” ([1])  
 – One paper on “Preventing Erosion in Exception Handling Design Using Static-Architecture Conformance Checking” ([8])  
   (Note: Another paper from 2017, “On Cognitive Biases in Architecture Decision Making” ([17]), is mentioned but its authorship by Manoj Bhat is not explicitly confirmed.)

• 2018  
 – One paper on “An Expert Recommendation System for Design Decision Making: Who Should be Involved in Making a Design Decision?” ([2])  
 – “Formally Describing Self-organizing Architectures for Systems-of-Systems on the Internet-of-Things” ([6])  
 – “A Blockchain‐Based Micro Economy Platform for Distributed Infrastructure Initiatives” ([7])  
 – “A Generic and Highly Scalable Framework for the Automation and Execution of Scientific Data Processing and Simulation Workflows” ([10])  
 – “Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared” ([13])  
 – “Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context” ([16])  
 – “ECo-IoT: An Architectural Approach for Realizing Emergent Configurations in the Internet of Things” ([19])  

• 2019  
 – “Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multi-level Greedy Modularity Clustering for Software Architecture Recovery” ([5])  
 – “Guiding Architectural Decision Making on Service Mesh Based Microservice Architectures” ([12])  
 – “The Safety Analysis Method for Cooperative Driving Systems” ([14])  
 – “Aspect-Oriented Modeling of Technology Heterogeneity in Microservice Architecture” ([15])  
 – “Microservice Architecture in Reality: An Industrial Inquiry” ([18])

 – “A Goal-Driven Approach for Deploying Self-Adaptive IoT Systems” ([21])

• 2021  
 – “Model-based Performance Analysis for Architecting Cyber-Physical Dynamic Spaces” ([11])

In summary, across the available texts every identified paper falls under Paper Class 1. Their distribution by publication year—assuming all texts refer to Manoj Bhat’s work—is as follows:  

 • 2017: at least 2 papers (with a possible additional one whose authorship is not explicit)  
 • 2018: 7 papers  
 • 2019: 5 papers (with one extra paper mentioned without explicit authorship)  
 • 2020: 4 papers

• In 2017 one research object was investigated ([7], [9], [17], [25]).  
• In 2018 one research object was investigated ([11]).  
• In 2019 one research object was investigated ([1], [5], [10], [16], [18], [20], [21]).  
• In 2020 one research object was investigated ([2], [3], [4], [6], [14], [19]).  
• In 2021 one research object was investigated ([8], [23], [24]).  

Thus, for each mentioned publication year, António Silva’s work appears to have involved exactly one research object.

Note that in many cases the exact count or detailed breakdown of objects per paper is not always fully specified, but the following distribution per publication year can be drawn directly from the texts:

• 2017 – Several texts indicate a paper (or multiple papers) from this year that investigate research objects. For example, one work [7] presents two research objects in a paper published in 2017; others [9, 25, 27, 29] mention single (or unspecified count) research objects from 2017.

• 2018 – The texts include at least one paper from 2018. One publication [2] is explicitly stated as contributing two research objects, another [11] shows a paper with one research object, and additional works [20, 21] each contribute one research object. Thus, the investigated objects for 2018 include at least one paper with two objects and others with one each.

• 2019 – Several papers from 2019 are reported. One paper [10] contributes two research objects, another [12] describes two research objects, and another work [15] reports two objects. Additional publications like those in [16], [17], [18], [23], and [28] are mentioned – with some stating a single research object and others two – so overall several distinct research objects are investigated in works published in 2019.

• 2020 – A number of papers are attributed to this year. For example, one work [1] is mentioned (though without details on the objects), another [4] identifies a publication from 2020, a paper [5] is reported as having two research objects, another [13] has two, and [26] (while more detailed) indicates multiple research objects in that year.

• 2021 – Several texts refer to 2021 papers. One publication [3] is associated with two research objects; another [6] refers to a paper from 2021 with unspecified but multiple objects; additionally [8] presents two research objects, [14] shows at least two, while [19], [22] and [24] refer to publications with one (or explicitly reported) research object each.

In summary, based solely on the provided texts, the objects of research investigated in Klym Shumaiev’s papers are distributed across at least five publication years (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021) with each year having one or more publications that report one or more research objects ([2], [3], [7]–[9], [10]–[12], [14]–[18], [20]–[29]).

 – “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” explicitly mentions 2 evaluation approaches (Technical Experiment and Questionnaire) [16].  
 – In one study (“Semi-automatic Feedback for Improving Architecture Conformance to Microservice Patterns and Practices”), the reporting gives 2 evaluation approaches (one with a “False” designation and one Technical Experiment) [18].  
 – “Trace Link Recovery for Software Architecture Documentation” shows 1 evaluation approach (Case Study) [25].  
 – Finally, “System- and Software-level Architecting Harmonization Practices …” is reported as applying 2 evaluation approaches (Focus Group and Interview) [26].

In summary, the provided texts show that for the same publication year there are multiple papers by Danny Weyns—each applying its own (and sometimes several) evaluation approaches. The numbers reported per year (with their respective source identifications) are as follows:

• 2017: 2 evaluation approaches (per [3] and [23]).

One partial answer states that the Recovery property is evaluated in Butterfly Space: An Architectural Approach for Investigating Performance Issues [1]. Another source links the evaluation to a paper titled Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multi-level Greedy Modularity Clustering for Software Architecture Recovery [2]. A third source explicitly names Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study as the paper in which Recovery is evaluated [3]. In contrast, another source explains that while the paper Recovering Architectural Design Decisions includes various evaluation properties (e.g., Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, etc.), it does not explicitly evaluate a property called “Recovery” [4]. 

Thus, the information provided points to three different papers in connection with the evaluation of Recovery.

One partial answer [1] indicates that two papers investigate the property Security, stating that one contribution is evaluated with an emphasis on Security and another with respect to a sub‐property Security. In contrast, the remaining sources [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], and [8] each report that only one paper explicitly investigates the property Security. 

Thus, while one text [1] mentions two papers, a majority of the texts indicate that one paper investigates the property Security.

• According to [3], the paper ACE: Easy Deployment of Field Optimization Experiments applies Field Experiment and was published in 2019.  
• As noted in [1], An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots uses Field Experiment and was published in 2018.  
• In [2], Decision Models for Microservices: Design Areas, Stakeholders, Use Cases, and Requirements is reported to use Field Experiment and was published in 2017.

Thus, combining these sources, the descending order of the papers by publication year is:  
1. ACE: Easy Deployment of Field Optimization Experiments (2019) [3]  
2. An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots (2018) [1]  
3. Decision Models for Microservices: Design Areas, Stakeholders, Use Cases, and Requirements (2017) [2]

It should be noted that [4] presents conflicting information stating that none of the papers explicitly apply a Field Experiment. However, based solely on the claims in [1], [2], and [3], the ranking above reflects the papers attributed with the Field Experiment evaluation method.

• Partial answers [1] and [2] state that no paper in the texts is described as applying the evaluation method Data Science. In these answers, the only discussed paper is evaluated as a Case Study and thus is not considered under the Data Science evaluation method.

• In contrast, partial answer [3] identifies one paper—""The Evolution of Technical Debt in the Apache Ecosystem""—as employing the Data Science evaluation method and notes that this paper has made its input data available.

Taking the information from [3] at face value, among papers that apply the evaluation method Data Science there is 1 paper that has made its input data available and 0 papers that have not used input data. However, it is important to note that [1] and [2] provide no examples of any paper using the Data Science evaluation method.

Thus, if one relies on the instance provided in [3], the answer is: 0 papers have not used input data compared to 1 that has made its input data available [1][2][3].

• Some sources indicate that one paper evaluating the Architecture Design Method was assessed for Portability while no paper was evaluated for Usability ([1], [7], [9]).  
• In contrast, other texts report that one paper was evaluated for Usability while no paper was evaluated for Portability ([2], [3], [4], [10], [11]).  
• One source presents a mixed finding: one instance of Portability evaluation versus two instances of Usability evaluation for a particular contribution ([5]).  
• Yet another source does not mention any evaluation of either property ([6], [8]).  

Thus, the provided texts yield inconsistent counts: depending on the paper, some investigations report one evaluation of Portability and none for Usability, others report one evaluation of Usability and none for Portability, and one account reports evaluations for both (with Usability evaluated twice vs. Portability once). There is no single consensus number across all sources.

• Some texts report that a paper investigating a reference architecture was evaluated only for portability with no mention of usability ([1], [6], [11]).

• In one case a single paper was evaluated for both sub-properties ([5]), and one answer mentioned two usability evaluations versus one portability evaluation ([4]).

Thus, while one contribution explicitly emphasized portability with no usability focus (or vice‐versa) in some reports, the majority of the texts describe reference architecture papers that focus on usability with no corresponding mention of portability. In summary, among the papers investigating a reference architecture the texts more frequently report an evaluation focus on usability compared to portability.

• According to [2], the paper “Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis” contributes an evaluation using a Questionnaire and further clarifies (in its Evidence 1) that “no input data was used.”

• In [3], the text explains that “Improving the Consistency and Usefulness of Architecture Descriptions: Guidelines for Architects” has a First Research Object 1 evaluated with a Questionnaire, with no indication in that instance that input data was used.

• [7] shows that “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” provides a contribution (First Research Object 1) evaluated by Questionnaire and does not associate this contribution with the use of input data.

• Finally, [9] points out that “Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study” presents a First Research Object 1 evaluated using a Questionnaire, and separately for its Evidence 1 it is explicitly stated that “no input data was used.”

Thus, the papers meeting the criteria are those mentioned in [2], [3], [7], and [9].

• [4] “Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared”  
 – The paper is stated to apply a controlled experiment and explicitly indicates that no input data was used.

• [5] “On the Understandability of Semantic Constraints for Behavioral Software Architecture Compliance: A Controlled Experiment”  
 – It is explicitly described as employing a controlled experiment and noted as not using any input data.

• [7] “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions”  
 – One description (as First Research Object 1) indicates that it was evaluated through a controlled experiment and does not mention input data availability.

• [8] “Improving the Search for Architecture Knowledge in Online Developer Communities”  
 – A contribution named First Research Object 1 for this paper was evaluated using a controlled experiment without any indication of available input data.

• [14] “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Experimentation Platform”  
 – Although the texts do not use the explicit phrase “controlled experiment,” the paper’s context within an experimentation framework implies that a controlled experiment was applied and it explicitly states that no input data was used.

Each of these papers meets both criteria: they apply a controlled experiment (or an experimentation approach that implies control) and do not have any input data available, as noted in the respective sources above.

Multiple papers—such as the work on Big Data Cyber Security Analytics [1], the multi-tenant blockchain-based systems study [2], and the PaaS Cloud Application design evaluation [3]—explicitly show that when they investigate reliability, they are categorized as Paper Class 1. Other examples, including the MQTT Brokers comparison [4] and the collaborative autonomous robots study [5], further confirm that evaluations of reliability occur under this paper class. Although some texts discuss Paper Class 1 without directly linking it to reliability [6], [7], [8], the overall evidence consistently indicates that Paper Class 1 is the designation most frequently associated with investigations of the property Reliability.

At the same time, other texts did not report any paper using Benchmark for the respective publication years ([3], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10]). 

Thus, if we consider only the texts that explicitly mention Benchmark, the frequency per publication year appears to be one paper for 2017, one paper for 2019, and one paper for 2020.

For some contributions a case study was used as the evaluation method [1], [7], [11], [12], [13], [15], [16], [18], [30]. Other works adopted a Technical Experiment—for instance, in instances where compatibility was assessed by experimenting with the system [2], [9], [21], [25]. A number of papers instead employed a Motivating Example to illustrate compatibility issues [3], [8], [17], [26], [28], [29]. In a further variation, one paper combined interviews with a field experiment to capture qualitative insights as part of its compatibility evaluation [10]. There is also an instance where the Focus Group method was applied [22], [23], and another evaluation was explicitly based on Grounded Theory, albeit within a broader evaluation framework [27]. Finally, one contribution was evaluated using an argumentation method [6].

In summary, for papers that evaluate compatibility the explicit evaluation methods include case studies, technical experiments, motivating examples, interviews (complemented by field experiments), focus groups, grounded theory, and argumentation.

Several partial answers state that—even though additional evaluation aspects (such as evaluation properties, sub‐properties, and different terminologies like “motivating example,” “case study,” or “technical experiment”) are mentioned—there is no indication that more than one distinct evaluation method is used explicitly for reliability [1], [2], [3], [10], [11], [12], [14], [15]. Some texts even point out that although other evaluation methods are mentioned for the overall evaluation of the research object (for instance, Technical Experiment or Argumentation [9]), none of these are directly linked as methods specifically to assess reliability. Thus, the final answer is that one evaluation method is applied.

For example, sources [1], [2], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], and [12] each point to the evaluation of only a single research object (referred to as First Research Object 1) within the context of compatibility. Although a few sources ([3], [4], [5], [6]) mention two research objects in their texts, they do not explicitly associate both with compatibility evaluations. Therefore, the coherent interpretation is that among the papers that evaluate compatibility, one research object is evaluated.

• In two papers (as noted in [1] and [2]), the method applied is Technical Experiment.

• In the paper “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” ([3]), two methods are used: Interview and Field Experiment (which, when ranked in descending alphabetical order, become Interview followed by Field Experiment).

• In another paper ([4]), the methods applied are Architecture Analysis Method and Case Study (yielding, in descending alphabetical order, Case Study followed by Architecture Analysis Method).

• The paper “A Platform Architecture for Multi-Tenant Blockchain‐Based Systems” ([5]) uses Technical Experiment and Argumentation; when ranked in descending alphabetical order the order is Technical Experiment followed by Argumentation.

Combining all these evaluation methods across the papers, the unique methods identified are:  
– Technical Experiment  
– Interview  
– Field Experiment  
– Case Study  
– Architecture Analysis Method  
– Argumentation

Thus, in the specific papers that address Architecture Evolution directly ([1] and [9]), both properties are evaluated with equal frequency (once each). However, across the broader set of texts, Satisfaction is explicitly evaluated in several studies, whereas Context Coverage is either mentioned once or not addressed at all. 

In summary, for papers investigating Architecture Evolution, there is evidence of one instance of each in two studies, but overall, Satisfaction is more consistently evaluated than Context Coverage.

However, some publications mentioned in other texts only report an evaluation for one of the two sub‐properties. For example, there are instances where only satisfaction is explicitly evaluated ([10], [11], [13], [15], [18], [19], [20]) while in others only context coverage is mentioned ([12], [14], [16], [17]). 

Thus, among publications that investigate architecture patterns, there is a subset in which satisfaction and context coverage are each evaluated once (and hence equally frequent), while in other cases only one of the properties (satisfaction or context coverage) is evaluated.

• One publication explicitly mentions evaluating maintainability only during a controlled (or technical) experiment [1].  
• Two publications report that both maintainability and usability are evaluated in their controlled experiments—with one instance noting each evaluation occurring once [2] and another instance explicitly listing one evaluation each for maintainability and usability [3].  
• In contrast, there are also publications where the controlled experiment focuses exclusively on usability, with no mention of maintainability [9] and [10].  

Thus, while some controlled experiments concretely report assessing maintainability or usability (or both), the provided texts do not show a consistent trend where one property is evaluated more often than the other. Instead, the evidence indicates that both maintainability and usability are evaluated depending on the publication, with some experiments covering both and others concentrating solely on one of these aspects [1], [2], [3], [9], [10].

In particular, the explicitly evaluated properties include:

1. An evaluation method, which has been instantiated in different cases as methods such as a case study, Data Science approach, Technical Experiment, Motivating Example, argumentation, and even a “Motivating Example” (see [1], [2], [3], [4], [11], [19], [25]).

2. An evaluation property that is most commonly identified as “Product Quality” (see [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [10], [12], [13], [14], [16], [22], [24], [25]). In some cases, other properties like “Quality in Use” or “Quality of Method” are also mentioned ([19], [23]).

3. An evaluation sub‐property that adds specificity to the evaluation property. The texts mention sub-properties such as “Functional Suitability” (by far the most frequently noted; see [1], [5], [7], [8], [12], [13], [20], [21], [22], [24], [25]), “Performance efficiency” (see [4], [11], [14], [16]), “Maintainability” (see [2]), “Context Coverage” (see [19]), and “Accuracy” (see [3], [23]).

4. A validity aspect where it is explicitly noted that the contributions do not reference (or adhere to) a Threats to Validity Guideline. In these cases, the “Referenced Threats to Validity Guideline” is marked as False, often with additional mentions of internal, external, or construct validity being considered (see [1], [3], [4], [7], [9], [16], [23], [22]).

Thus, synthesizing the partial answers, even when a paper does not adhere to an evaluation guideline, it still reports its evaluation through a combination of the following properties:
 – An evaluation method (e.g., case study, Data Science, Motivating Example, Technical Experiment, argumentation).
 – An evaluation property (typically “Product Quality” but also including items like “Quality in Use” or “Quality of Method”).
 – An evaluation sub‐property (most commonly “Functional Suitability,” with instances of “Performance efficiency,” “Maintainability,” “Context Coverage,” and “Accuracy”).
 – A validity note that explicitly states non-adherence to a Threats to Validity Guideline.

For example, many sources note that a key research object (referred to as First Research Object 1) was evaluated without a guideline. This object was assessed with respect to properties such as Functional Suitability (evaluated as a sub‐property), Product Quality, and—depending on the particular study—even properties like Performance efficiency, Quality of Method, Accuracy, Effectiveness, and Quality in Use [1][2][3][11][13][15][26][29]. In parallel, other texts indicate that another research object (referred to as Second Research Object 1) was also evaluated without a guideline; in that case, the evaluation aspects (including its evaluation sub‐property, evaluation property, and even the evaluation method, for example via Focus Group) were carried out without the support of a guideline [7][8][22][24][28]. Additionally, there are instances (for example, with a contribution labeled Validity 1) in which the Threats to Validity Guideline was not referenced, meaning that the evaluation related to threats (or validity aspects) was also performed without following a guideline [5][16][17][18][19][25][29].

In summary, among the publications investigating architectural assumptions, the evaluation properties (or aspects) that were assessed without following a guideline include:

• Functional Suitability  
• Product Quality  
• Performance efficiency  
• Quality of Method  
• Accuracy  
• Effectiveness  
• Security (in some instances)  
• And, regarding validity, the evaluation of threats to validity (Validity 1)

Each of these points is explicitly supported by citations from the provided texts [1][2][3][5][6][7][8][9][11][12][13][15][16][17][18][19][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29].

Some texts (e.g., [1], [2], [6], [8], [9], [10]) indicate that although “First Research Object 1” is evaluated without an evaluation guideline, it is not evaluated using Field Experiment. Conversely, other texts such as [7] mention Field Experiment but also state that when it is used (for “First Research Object 1”), an evaluation guideline is present. Therefore, there is no research object that is evaluated without an evaluation guideline using the evaluation method Field Experiment.

In several publications (see [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [10], [11], [22], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], and [30]), the research objects that are evaluated without using an evaluation guideline are identified as First Research Object 1 and Second Research Object 1. That is, both objects were explicitly reported as not having an evaluation guideline (or having it set to False).

It is important to note, however, that although the question refers to publications that apply grounded theory in their evaluation, none of the provided texts explicitly mention that the application of grounded theory is linked to these evaluation practices. In most cases the use of grounded theory is assumed or not mentioned at all—while the detailed information clearly indicates that First Research Object 1 and Second Research Object 1 are evaluated without using a guideline.

Thus, the final answer is:

First Research Object 1 and Second Research Object 1 are evaluated without using an evaluation guideline—even though there is no explicit indication in the texts that grounded theory is applied in these evaluations.

Four sources ([2], [5], [6], [8]) explicitly state that a Case Study is used as the evaluation method, while three sources ([3], [4], [7]) specify a Technical Experiment. Although one text ([1]) mentions a Motivating Example method, this is not linked to papers investigating the research object Technical Debt.

It is important to note that none of the texts explicitly connect any evaluation method to papers that investigate Technical Debt. However, considering the frequency of the explicit mentions, the Case Study approach appears as the most applied evaluation method in the evidence provided. 

Thus, the answer is that the most explicitly mentioned evaluation method is the Case Study ([2], [5], [6], [8]), with the clear caveat that no text directly links this evaluation method to papers investigating Technical Debt.

• Maintainability, which is highlighted in several accounts [1], [17].  
• Product Quality, a property repeatedly mentioned across many texts [1], [2], [6], [9], [11], [20].  
• Functional Suitability, which appears as an important sub‐property in multiple instances [1], [7], [18].  

In addition to these core properties, other evaluation aspects are often investigated, such as:  

• Quality in Use – noted as an evaluation property in various descriptions [4], [7], [9], [11].  
• Effectiveness – explicitly mentioned in some texts [4], [16], [17].  
• Performance Efficiency – appearing as a sub‐property or evaluation aspect in several studies [10], [11], [20].  
• Quality of Method and Accuracy – both commonly referenced as evaluation criteria in the research object investigations [3], [8], [10], [15].  

Other properties like usability, portability, and security are also noted in certain contributions [12], [20], [21], but the most consistently observed investigations focus on maintainability, product quality, functional suitability, quality in use, effectiveness, performance efficiency, and aspects related to the quality of the method and accuracy. 

It is worth noting that while the texts do not explicitly reference “Technical Debt” by name in all cases, they suggest that if Technical Debt were to be treated as a research object in a similar context, the evaluation would likely focus on these properties [1], [4], [7], [9], [16], [17].

Several publications explicitly mention Product Quality as a primary evaluation property (see [3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [13], [15], [16], [17], [19], [20], [24], [27], [28], [29], [30]). Similarly, Functional Suitability is frequently evaluated, being expressly noted in multiple publications (see [2], [6], [11], [20], [27], [28], [29]). 

In addition to these two properties, other evaluation aspects appear repeatedly across publications. For example, Quality in Use is mentioned in several instances ([1], [4], [12], [18], [25]), and properties such as Effectiveness, Accuracy, and Performance efficiency are also evaluated in various studies ([1], [2], [6], [9], [10], [16], [21], [22], [26], [30]). However, when it comes to the most consistently and frequently mentioned properties, Product Quality and Functional Suitability stand out across the examined literature.

One paper—“Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution”—employs a Technical Experiment [8]. Another paper—“Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems”—explicitly mentions that a Technical Experiment is used (in addition to a Questionnaire) for its study of Architecture Evolution [12]. Therefore, among the evaluation methods reported for papers on Architecture Evolution in 2021, the Technical Experiment is the one applied most frequently [8][12].

• In 2018, the evaluation method Benchmark is not mentioned, so it was applied 0 times ([2]).  
• In 2019, multiple publications were discussed, but none applied the Benchmark evaluation method (both results showing False or using other methods), so it was applied 0 times ([3], [4]).  
• In 2020, one publication (""Employment of Optimal Approximations on Apache Hadoop Checkpoint Technique for Performance Improvements"") explicitly noted employing Benchmark as its evaluation method. Therefore, in 2020 the evaluation method Benchmark was applied 1 time ([5]).  
• In 2021, the evaluation method Benchmark was explicitly set to False, indicating 0 applications for that year ([1]).  

Thus, Benchmark was applied 0 times in 2018, 0 times in 2019, 1 time in 2020, and 0 times in 2021.

In several texts the evaluation methods for various research objects are described—with methods such as Focus Group [2, 7], Technical Experiment [3, 9, 10], Case Study [4, 5, 6], Motivating Example [8], and even a Data Science approach [1] mentioned—but none of these sources explicitly attribute any one of these methods directly to the FLRA paper. For example, while some texts associate First Research Object 1 with Technical Experiments or Case Study approaches, others mention a Focus Group and even a Motivating Example for different contributions. 

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, one must conclude that no explicit evaluation method for ""FLRA: A Reference Architecture for Federated Learning Systems"" is stated. (See [3], [5], and [7] for the discussion that no direct information regarding the FLRA paper is provided.)

For example, one set of papers used questionnaires and focus groups (see [1], [14], [15], and [16]). Other contributions employed qualitative methods such as Grounded Theory (see [3], [5], and [6]) and controlled experiments (see [8] and [13]). In addition, some studies used case studies ([7], [25], [29]) or technical experiments (see [10], [13], and [22]), while one paper applied a field experiment ([11]). Complementary evaluation methods mentioned include interviews (see [12], [16], [18], and [19]), an argumentation method ([17]), data science approaches ([4] and [21]), a motivating example ([24]), and even a benchmark as part of the evaluation ([22]). 

Thus, the evaluation methods explicitly applied in papers investigating Architecture Decision Making include:  
• Questionnaire,  
• Focus Group,  
• Grounded Theory,  
• Controlled Experiment,  
• Case Study,  
• Technical Experiment,  
• Field Experiment,  
• Interview,  
• Argumentation Method,  
• Data Science approach,  
• Motivating Example, and  
• Benchmark.  

Each of these methods was associated with additional evaluation aspects (such as quality in use, effectiveness, and accuracy) in the corresponding papers ([1]–[29]).

For instance, several papers use a Technical Experiment to assess accuracy [1, 3, 4, 11, 13, 17, 21, 25, 24]. In addition, a number of papers apply a Case Study method for this purpose [2, 5, 10, 14, 15, 16, 22, 26, 29, 30]. Other distinct methods mentioned include the Data Science approach [6, 9], Focus Group [7], Grounded Theory [8, 19], Argumentation method [12], Benchmark [18, 23, 24], and a Controlled Experiment [22]. 

Thus, the evaluation methods applied to assess accuracy across Duc Le’s papers include:
• Technical Experiment  
• Case Study  
• Data Science  
• Focus Group  
• Grounded Theory  
• Argumentation method  
• Benchmark  
• Controlled Experiment

Each of these methods is explicitly associated with the evaluation of the Accuracy sub‐property of the respective research objects [1–30].

In particular, the following methods have been applied:

• An interview was used in at least one case to evaluate usability [2], [16].  
• A technical experiment is by far the most frequently mentioned method. This approach was applied in several papers to assess usability [3], [4], [6], [9], [13], [14], [15], [19], [22], [25], [29].  
• A controlled experiment was applied to evaluate usability in other instances [7], [8], [19], [23].  
• A case study was also employed in some papers to assess usability—or to evaluate object properties that include usability aspects (sometimes described through “Quality in Use”) [5], [10], [18], [21], [27].  
• Additionally, other evaluation approaches included a focus group [11], [20] and the use of a questionnaire [9], [20], [22].  
• One paper applied argumentation as a method for evaluating usability [1], [23].  
• Finally, one study used a benchmark method as its explicit evaluation approach [28], while another instance mentioned the Architecture Analysis Method as part of an evaluation process [17], [24].

Each of these methods was applied in the context of evaluating usability either directly or as part of a broader assessment of quality in use or related properties, thereby highlighting the multifaceted approaches used in Lu Xiao’s research.

• Some sources indicate that the research object was evaluated using a Case Study—several texts ([2], [3], [5], [8], [21], [22], [23], [25], [26], [29], [30]) explicitly state that a Case Study was applied.

• Other texts report that a Technical Experiment was used. This method is mentioned in [1], [4], [7], [10], [17], and [28] (with additional evaluation properties such as Quality of Method and Accuracy being noted).

• A third set of texts refers to the use of a Motivating Example as the evaluation method ([15], [16], [18], [20]).

• In one instance, an evaluation is described as employing Grounded Theory (and, in a related mention, Verification as an evaluation approach) ([14], [19]).

Thus, Stephan Seifermann’s work on the Architecture Analysis Method has been evaluated using several approaches: a Case Study, a Technical Experiment, a Motivating Example, and in at least one account, Grounded Theory (with an associated mention of Verification). Each of these methods is complemented by various evaluation properties (such as Quality (of Method, in Use, or Product), Accuracy, and Functional Suitability) as detailed in the sources.

For example, one contribution—namely “Incremental Calibration of Architectural Performance Models with Parametric Dependencies” (as indicated in [3])—applied the case study method, while another contribution (“Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” as noted in [6]) was evaluated using a technical experiment. Thus, the answer is that two different evaluation methods were applied [3], [6].

Only two sources mention more than one method ([15] claiming three distinct evaluation approaches and [26] reporting two evaluation methods). However, the vast majority of the partial answers indicate that exactly one evaluation method was explicitly applied by the author Georg Buchgeher for this purpose.

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, the final answer is that one evaluation method has been applied.

Some sources indicate that only one evaluation method was explicitly applied (for example, Technical Experiment, Interview, Case Study, Grounded Theory, Motivating Example, Argumentation, or Data Science, as noted in [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [9], [12]–[14], [15]–[21], [23]–[25]), while other sources state that two different evaluation methods were applied (for example, combining a Questionnaire and a Case Study as in [1], a Motivating Example and an Architecture Design Method as in [7], or two methods such as Technical Experiment and Architecture Analysis Method as in [10], with further support in [22] and [26]). 

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, there is conflicting evidence: some sources (e.g., [1], [7], [10], [22], [26]) report two evaluation methods, whereas others list only one.

In some accounts (for example, [1] and [14]), for a specific research object related to Architecture Decision Making (namely, First Research Object 1) two evaluation methods were employed. These methods are noted as, for instance, the combination of a benchmark and a technical experiment [1] or the combination of a questionnaire and a focus group [14]. In other instances, a single evaluation method is explicitly mentioned. For example, one text refers to an argumentation method [2], another to interviews [3], yet another to a questionnaire [4], another to a focus group (and similar cases in [8], [12], and [13]), and additional texts mention either technical experiment [11, 17], Data Science [9, 10] or Grounded Theory [15, 18, 19]. 

Thus, depending on the paper or research instance, Ingo Weber’s work on Architecture Decision Making was reported to use either a single evaluation method or a combination of two methods. The overall synthesis shows that the evaluation method count is not consistent across all works: some investigations applied only one clear evaluation method, while at least one investigation applied two evaluation methods. 

In summary, the texts indicate that in the papers investigating Architecture Decision Making, Ingo Weber applied evaluation methods that number either one or two depending on the particular study ([1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [8]–[10], [11]–[14], [15]–[17], [19]).

Although none of the excerpts explicitly names Mohamed Soliman as an author, the question’s context is taken to mean that the papers (which use a technical experiment) are his. The evaluation properties vary between studies, with some papers assessing “Product Quality” and “Performance efficiency” (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [6], [8], [12], [16], [26], [29]) and others evaluating sets that include properties such as “Quality of Method” and “Accuracy” (e.g., [5], [7], [14], [19], [20], [25], [27]). Still other papers address additional properties such as “Security”, “Quality in Use”, “Robustness”, “Satisfaction”, “Functional Suitability”, “Efficiency”, “Effectiveness” and “Context coverage” ([15], [17], [21], [22], [23], [24], [30]). 

Collecting all the explicitly mentioned evaluation properties from the provided texts, the union of names is as follows (ignoring any duplicate mentions):

• Accuracy  
• Context coverage  
• Effectiveness  
• Efficiency  
• Functional Suitability  
• Performance efficiency  
• Product Quality  
• Quality in Use  
• Quality of Method  
• Robustness  
• Satisfaction  
• Security  

When these are ranked in descending alphabetical order—that is, from the highest letter values down to the lowest—the ordered list is:

1. Security  
2. Satisfaction  
3. Robustness  
4. Quality of Method  
5. Quality in Use  
6. Product Quality  
7. Performance efficiency  
8. Functional Suitability  
9. Efficiency  
10. Effectiveness  
11. Context coverage  
12. Accuracy  

This comprehensive list combines the evaluation properties as reported in the texts (see sources [1]–[30]) and is provided in the requested descending alphabetical order.

Note that the sources do not all agree exactly on the list; rather, different texts focus on different contributions and details. In what follows the sources are cited in square brackets.

One set of texts ([2], [3], [6], [9]) reports that the research contributions were evaluated with the properties “Product Quality” and “Performance efficiency.” In these cases, when the two are arranged in descending alphabetical order (i.e. comparing the first letters “P”), “Product Quality” comes before “Performance efficiency.”

Other texts report additional or alternative properties. For example, source [8] provides four evaluation properties (or evaluation property/sub-property details) for contributions using the Technical Experiment method: “Quality of Method”, “Product Quality”, “Performance efficiency”, and “Functional Suitability.” Arranged in descending alphabetical order, this list becomes:
  1. Quality of Method  
  2. Product Quality  
  3. Performance efficiency  
  4. Functional Suitability

Meanwhile, source [5] describes three evaluation aspects (including sub-properties) as “Quality in Use”, “Efficiency”, and “Effectiveness.” In descending alphabetical order these are:
  1. Quality in Use  
  2. Efficiency  
  3. Effectiveness

Similarly, source [7] reports that a contribution was evaluated using “Quality in Use” and “Performance efficiency” (with the descending order being “Quality in Use” then “Performance efficiency”) and source [10] presents “Quality of Method” alongside a sub‐property “Accuracy” (with “Quality of Method” preceding “Accuracy” when ordered descending alphabetically).

In summary, the investigations by the author related to contributions evaluated via the Technical Experiment method include the following reported properties and, where applicable, sub‐properties (each list already arranged in descending alphabetical order according to its source):
  
• According to [2], [3], [6], and [9]:  
  Product Quality  
  Performance efficiency

• According to [8]:  
  Quality of Method  
  Product Quality  
  Performance efficiency  
  Functional Suitability

• According to [5]:  
  Quality in Use  
  Efficiency  
  Effectiveness

• According to [7]:  
  Quality in Use  
  Performance efficiency

• According to [10]:  
  Quality of Method  
  Accuracy

Thus, while differing texts emphasize different aspects, the overall evaluation properties (and sub-properties) investigated via Technical Experiment include “Product Quality,” “Performance efficiency,” “Quality of Method,” “Functional Suitability,” “Quality in Use,” “Efficiency,” “Effectiveness,” and “Accuracy” – each set reported in descending alphabetical order as noted in the respective sources.

• One text [2] indicates that a 2020 paper (“Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis”) employed the Questionnaire as its evaluation method. Several other texts associated with 2020 either report different evaluation methods (e.g., Case Study or Technical Experiment) or do not mention a Questionnaire [3, 5, 7, 8, 9].

• For 2021, at least one source [4] explicitly states that there is a paper (“Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems”) in which the Questionnaire evaluation method is applied. An additional source [6] also identifies another 2021 work (“How Software Architects Focus Their Attention”) as using the Questionnaire evaluation method, while one source [1] mentions a 2021 paper that does not use any evaluation method (or explicitly marks it as False).

Thus, while the evidence is not entirely consistent, the available texts suggest that:
– In 2020, there is at least one instance (from [2]) of using the Questionnaire, although many 2020 papers reported other evaluation methods.
– In 2021, there appear to be one or more instances of applying the Questionnaire method (as indicated by [4] and [6]).

Therefore, the occurrence of the Questionnaire evaluation method is sparse in both years. However, the evidence leans toward its explicit use in at least one 2020 paper and in multiple 2021 papers.

For example, several contributions (see [1], [2], [6], [8], [10], [19], and [21]) note that the research object—usually referred to as “First Research Object 1”—is explicitly evaluated (using methods such as Grounded Theory, controlled experiments, technical experiments, questionnaires, or similar approaches). Although a few texts (for instance, [3], [4], [5], [11], [13], [16], [17], [22], [24], and [26]) mention the absence of an “evaluation guideline” for either the First or Second research object, the absence of a guideline does not necessarily imply that no evaluation method was applied. In several cases, differences appear to be made between having a full evaluation method (the procedure to assess the object) and the presence of a guideline (a supporting or additional evaluation property).

In conclusion, when strictly considering evaluation methods (and not additional evaluation guidelines or properties), the collected information supports that all research objects have been evaluated using some method. Therefore, based on the provided texts, no research object investigated by Uwe Zdun has been applied without an evaluation method. (See [1], [2], [6], [8], [10], [19], and [21].)

For example, a case study was used [1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 21, 24] and it is explicitly noted that no evaluation guideline was applied. In addition, a technical experiment was employed on various contributions (as seen in [2, 4, 11, 16, 23, 26, 28, 29]) with the evaluation guideline explicitly marked as false. The motivating example method is also mentioned as being used without an accompanying evaluation guideline [3, 22, 25, 30]. Furthermore, grounded theory was used in one instance without its supporting evaluation guideline [13, 27], and one work reports the use of a focus group method (where again the evaluation guideline was set to false) [19]. Finally, in several works the assessment labeled as “Validity 1” (which addresses aspects such as threats to validity) was conducted without referencing the Threats to Validity Guideline [2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 16, 20, 22, 29]. 

Thus, the methods that were used without an evaluation guideline are:  
– Case study  
– Technical experiment  
– Motivating example  
– Grounded theory  
– Focus group  
– And evaluations addressing validity (Validity 1)  

These findings are explicitly supported by the various text references ([1] through [30]) provided.

• In one paper, a Motivating Example was used as the evaluation method while also assessing product quality, functional suitability, and conducting a validity analysis (where Validity 1 did not reference the Threats to Validity Guideline) [6], [22].  
• In another paper, a Technical Experiment was explicitly employed without a guideline [7].  
• A further contribution used a Technical Experiment accompanied by specific evaluation aspects (namely, assessments of the quality of the method and accuracy) and was carried out without an evaluation guideline [17].  
• In addition, one publication—ACE: Easy Deployment of Field Optimization Experiments—was evaluated using a Field Experiment, also noting that the evaluation (including properties such as quality in use and effectiveness) was performed without an evaluation guideline [18].

These details, drawn from the texts, illustrate that in the relevant papers published by Johannes Grohmann, multiple evaluation methods (Motivating Example, Technical Experiment, Field Experiment, and validity assessments) were applied without using any formal evaluation guideline.

Several texts explicitly note in an element called “Evidence 1” that no input data was used; however, in most cases Evidence 1 is mentioned as supporting information rather than as the primary research object [6], [11], [19], [22], [23], [27]. 

Thus, the coherent final answer is as follows: 

The research object investigated in publications from Davide Arcelli that did not use input data is “First Research Object 1.” In some cases the contribution “Evidence 1” is also mentioned as explicitly not using input data, but “First Research Object 1” is the consistently identified research object across the publications [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [20], [21], [24], [25], [26], [28].

For example, one set of texts indicates that Product Quality is explicitly used as the evaluation property (as noted in [5], [8], [18], and [26]) while other sources highlight aspects such as Accuracy ([7], [12], [15]), Quality of Method ([19], [25]), or even effectiveness ([4], [10], [23]). In some cases, the texts clarify that although several evaluation properties are mentioned, Product Quality is referenced more than once (see [8] where Product Quality appears twice) and is thereby emphasized as the main evaluation criterion.

Thus, when considering the contributions that represent architecture analysis methods in the papers by Romina Eramo, the property most frequently evaluated—as explicitly stated in multiple instances—is Product Quality [5], [8], [18], [26].

In several sources it is stated that the contribution’s first research object (although not explicitly labeled as “Architecture Extraction”) is evaluated using a Case Study [1], [2], [4], [10], [14], [18], [25]. (It should be noted that many of the texts explain that although the research object in question is labeled as “First Research Object 1” or is otherwise related to architectural aspects, none of them provide an explicit designation “Architecture Extraction.”)

Some texts also mention methods such as Technical Experiment [9], [11], [12], [15], [19], [21], [22], and even techniques like Motivating Example [17], [28] or Benchmark [3], [5]. However, when considering papers in the Proposal of Solution class that are linked to an architecture‐related research object, the only evaluation method that is repeatedly and explicitly named is the Case Study.

Thus, while additional methods (such as Technical Experiment) are mentioned, the most explicit and consistently applied evaluation method in the contributions of this paper class is the Case Study methodology.

For example, [1], [2], [6], [8], [12], [13], [15], [18], [20], [21], [26], and [27] explicitly indicate that a Technical Experiment was used. Although several other evaluation methods such as Case Study, Benchmark, Grounded Theory, Controlled Experiment, and others are mentioned in different papers, they occur less frequently in the provided instances. Therefore, the available evidence supports that the Technical Experiment is the evaluation method most often applied to evaluate architecture evolution in the 2020 papers.

• Some texts indicate that the only instance of a research object evaluated using the Data Science method was published outside the 2019–2021 window—for example, [1], [6], and [7] mention a paper evaluated with Data Science but published in 2018.  
• Two texts ([2] and [5]) state that in 2021 one research object was evaluated using Data Science and that no such evaluations are reported for 2019 or 2020.  
• In contrast, [4] reports one evaluation in 2019 and none in 2020 or 2021, while [3], [8], and [9] indicate that none of the publication years (2019–2021) include an evaluation using Data Science.

Thus, the available texts are not fully consistent. However, if we follow the group of partial answers that provide explicit counts for the years 2019–2021 ([2] and [5]), the answer would be as follows:

  • 2019: 0 evaluations using Data Science  
  • 2020: 0 evaluations using Data Science  
  • 2021: 1 evaluation using Data Science

It should be noted that other texts ([4], for example) report a different year (2019) for the single evaluation, and several sources state that no evaluation in the 2019–2021 period fits the criteria. Therefore, based on the provided texts, there is conflicting evidence. The majority of the explicit counts ([2] and [5]) suggest that among the publication years 2019 to 2021 there is one instance—occurring in 2021—where a research object was evaluated using the Data Science method, with none reported for 2019 or 2020.

Several texts report that in 2017 publications evaluating compatibility applied one or more evaluation methods. For example, some texts indicate that a 2017 publication employed a “Motivating Example” (as noted in [1], [3], [8], [17]) while others report that 2017 studies used alternative methods such as a case study ([6], [16]), an argumentation method with additional quality properties ([5]), or even Data Science ([24]). In general, when a 2017 publication is mentioned in the context of evaluating compatibility, the evaluation method tends to be explicitly identified (e.g., Motivating Example, case study, Focus Group, or Data Science) and there is no further evidence of studies using 2017 data that applied a different evaluation method.

In contrast, a number of texts exclusively mention publications from 2019 in which compatibility was evaluated. These 2019 contributions show a wider diversity of evaluation methods. For instance, some studies applied a case study ([2], [7], [10], [11], [18], [19]), while others used a technical experiment ([9], [12], [22], [28]). Additionally, other publications employed Grounded Theory ([13], [25]), Focus Group ([15]), or interviews ([26], [27]). In the information provided for 2019, the evaluation methods are often further detailed with associated evaluation properties (such as “Quality in Use,” “Product Quality,” “Functional Suitability,” “Accuracy,” or Maintainability) and mention whether an evaluation guideline was used.

Thus, among the publications that evaluate compatibility between 2017 and 2019, the distribution can be summarized as follows:

• 2017:  
 – At least one publication applied the “Motivating Example” approach (as reported in [1], [3], [8], [17]).  
 – Other 2017 studies employed methods such as case studies ([6], [16]), an argumentation method ([5]), or even a data science approach ([24]).  

• 2019:  
 – Multiple publications were reported, with evaluation methods including case studies ([2], [7], [10], [11], [18], [19]), technical experiments ([9], [12], [22], [28]), Grounded Theory ([13], [25]), Focus Group ([15]), and interviews ([26], [27]).  
 – These studies often provided additional evaluation details such as associated quality properties, effectiveness measures, or explicit notes on guidelines.

Overall, while some texts indicate that for 2017 only a single mode (or a limited set) of evaluation methods is observed, the 2019 publications show a broader array of evaluation strategies. The provided texts do not consistently cover both years together; some contributions mention only the 2017 instances and others only the 2019 ones, but taken together they reveal that compatibility evaluation methods in the literature have been applied either via Motivating Example, case study, argumentation, Data Science, or Focus Group in 2017 and via case studies, technical experiments, Grounded Theory, Focus Groups, or interviews in 2019 ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]).

Source [1] states that ""Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study"" is the only paper published in 2019 involving a research object corresponding to Architecture Extraction. Additionally, source [6] clearly indicates that ""Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multi-level Greedy Modularity Clustering for Software Architecture Recovery"" (published in 2019) is associated with a research object focused on Architecture Extraction. All other sources either mention different research objects or do not explicitly confirm an investigation of Architecture Extraction.

Thus, when focusing solely on the research object Architecture Extraction in 2019, the texts support that one paper (from source [6]) explicitly meets that criterion, while source [1] provides an example that is subject to interpretation regarding its research object contribution. Given the explicit association described in source [6], the final answer is:

There is one paper published in 2019 that investigated the research object Architecture Extraction [1][6].

• Some sources ([1] and [4]) indicate that a paper investigating Architecture Evolution was published in 2020 (namely, “Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization” in [1] and “Incremental Calibration of Architectural Performance Models with Parametric Dependencies” in [4]) and state that no 2021 paper explicitly investigates Architecture Evolution.

• In contrast, other texts ([2] and [3]) report a paper published in 2021 as addressing Architecture Evolution (for example, “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” in [2] and “Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” in [3]) while not mentioning any paper from 2020.

• The remaining sources ([5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]) either do not explicitly associate any paper to the research object Architecture Evolution or refer to contributions linked with different research objects, leaving no clear evidence of a paper on Architecture Evolution in either publication year.

Thus, depending on the source, the results are inconsistent. According to [1] and [4] there is one paper investigating Architecture Evolution in 2020 and none in 2021; according to [2] and [3] there is one paper in 2021 and none in 2020; and several other sources do not provide any explicit indication for either year.

Without additional clarification or reconciliation of these conflicting accounts, the synthesized answer is that the provided texts do not agree on a single count—some indicate one paper for 2020 while others indicate one for 2021, and many sources provide no relevant information for either year.

• According to sources [1] and [4], one paper published in 2017 (“Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks” and “The Evolution of Technical Debt in the Apache Ecosystem”) evaluates maintainability, with no paper in 2020 being mentioned as doing so.

• In contrast, sources [2] and [3] report that one paper published in 2020 (either “Architectural Technical Debt: A Grounded Theory” or “A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing”) evaluates maintainability, while no effort evaluating maintainability is mentioned for any 2017 publication.

• Finally, sources [5] and [6] note that although there is a paper from 2017, there is no explicit indication that it evaluates maintainability; likewise, no paper from 2020 is reported to evaluate maintainability.

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, there is conflicting evidence: some partial answers assert that a 2017 publication evaluates maintainability while others attribute this evaluation to a 2020 publication, and some indicate that neither publication year includes an evaluation of maintainability.

• ""Recovering Architectural Design Decisions"" – This paper investigates architecture decision making and, although it was published in 2018, its input data was used but is not available [1].  
• ""Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision-Making in an Agile Context"" – This study examines architecture decision making, was published in 2018, and no input data was used [6].  
• ""Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events: A Qualitative Multi-method Study"" – This paper focuses on architecture decision making, was published in 2018, and the input data employed is not available [8].  
• ""Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context"" – Although it does not use any input data, this paper (published in 2018) is explicitly linked to the investigation of architecture decision making [9].  
• ""The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Experimentation Platform"" – This work investigates aspects of architecture decision making (through its contribution as an Architecture Description) and clearly indicates that no input data were used, despite being published in 2018 [18].

Thus, the final answer is that the following papers meet all the criteria:  
""Recovering Architectural Design Decisions"" [1],  
""Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision-Making in an Agile Context"" [6],  
""Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events: A Qualitative Multi-method Study"" [8],  
""Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context"" [9], and  
""The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Experimentation Platform"" [18].

The only exception is described in partial answer [2], which indicates that the paper titled ""On Cognitive Biases in Architecture Decision Making"" was published in 2017, used the Focus Group evaluation method, and did not use input data. All other texts either attribute a different publication year, a different evaluation method, or the use of input data.

On one hand, several sources report that papers addressing Architecture Extraction were published exclusively in 2018—with no corresponding paper in 2020. For example, one source indicates that “Towards Micro Service Architecture Recovery: An Empirical Study” (which focuses on Architecture Extraction) was published in 2018 and that no 2020 publication on this research object exists ([1], [7], [8], [9], [11], [12]). On the other hand, other texts explicitly state that a paper titled “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” was published in 2020 and investigates Architecture Extraction ([2]). In addition, another source describes “Model-Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns” as a 2020 publication, though it is more associated with Architecture Analysis methods rather than explicitly labeled as Architecture Extraction ([13]). 

Thus, while one grouping of the texts asserts that the only relevant publication on Architecture Extraction falls in 2018, another grouping identifies a corresponding publication in 2020.

Several sources state that a single paper from 2018 is the only relevant work on the topic. For example, sources [1], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [10], [12], [15], [18], [19], [24], [25], and [28] indicate that the sole paper was published in 2018, with no additional papers from 2019 or 2020.

Conversely, another group of sources report that the only paper fitting this description was published in 2020. In particular, sources [2], [3], [13], [16], [17], [20], [21], [22], [23], [26], and [27] explicitly indicate that the paper in question appeared in 2020, again with no identified contributions in 2018 or 2019.

A single source [11] uniquely reports a publication from 2019 as the only paper that investigates the object architecture description in that period.

Thus, according to the provided texts, there is no single, uniform distribution. Some texts indicate a sole paper in 2018, others report a sole paper in 2020, and one source identifies one paper from 2019. No additional papers or a more detailed breakdown across these three years are provided.

Two sets of sources indicate that at least one paper using Argumentation was published in 2019 and another in 2020. In particular, sources [1] and [4] report that a paper published in 2019 employs the evaluation method Argumentation, while sources [2] and [7] point to a paper from 2020 using the same method. No source confirms any paper with the Argumentation method from 2021. 

At the same time, other sources ([3], [5], [6], [8], [9], and [10]) either associate papers using Argumentation with publication years outside the 2019–2021 range or state that no such evaluation method is mentioned in the provided texts. 

Thus, depending on which sources are considered more definitive, one interpretation is that there are two papers—one in 2019 and one in 2020—using the evaluation method Argumentation, with no papers in 2021. Alternatively, several sources claim that no papers in that year range use Argumentation. 

In summary, while some texts ([1], [2], [4], and [7]) suggest a distribution of one paper in 2019 and one in 2020, other texts ([3], [5], [6], [8], [9], and [10]) indicate that there are no papers with Argumentation in the 2019–2021 period.

On one hand, several sources indicate that a paper published in 2019 used Grounded Theory for evaluation. Source [1] mentions that “Guiding Architectural Decision Making on Service Mesh Based Microservice Architectures” (2019) used Grounded Theory. Similarly, source [2] points out that “How Developers Discuss Architecture Smells? An Exploratory Study on Stack Overflow” (also 2019) evaluated its contribution using Grounded Theory, and source [3] states that “Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures” (2019) used the same method. These sources suggest the presence of papers using Grounded Theory in 2019.

In contrast, source [4] reports that “Assessing Architecture Conformance to Coupling-Related Patterns and Practices in Microservices” used Grounded Theory and was published in 2020, implying that one paper in 2020 employed this evaluation method.

Finally, source [5] notes that the paper from 2021 did not use Grounded Theory, and source [6] indicates that none of the papers (including a 2019 publication) used Grounded Theory for evaluation.

In summary, while some texts explicitly mention papers from 2019 and 2020 using Grounded Theory for evaluation, others report that no such use occurred. Thus, the distribution of papers using Grounded Theory between 2019 and 2021 is unclear, with indications of one or more papers from 2019 (or even 2020) employing the method, and no evidence of its use in 2021.
