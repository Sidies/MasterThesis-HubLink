Only one partial answer ([20]) indicates that “Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud‐Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks” is a personal experience paper (published in 2017). However, every other source ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], and [30]) explicitly states that the paper in question is not a personal experience paper.

Since the vast majority of the partial answers agree that no paper qualifies as having the paper class personal experience paper, there is no list or ranking to produce in descending order of publication year.

Thus, the final answer is: No papers have the paper class personal experience paper.

(Note that several texts offer work‐by‐work details—with associated publication years and “Paper Class” characterizations—assuming these works are part of Mohamed Soliman’s publication record.)

In summary, among the papers for which the texts explicitly attribute the work to Mohamed Soliman (or imply it in the context of the question), the details can be organized by publication year as follows:

• 2017  
 – One paper (“Designing Robust Software Systems through Parametric Markov Chain Synthesis”) is reported as having a contribution labeled Classifications_2. In this work the paper is assigned the “Paper Class” (without additional attribute details beyond its classification) [17].

• 2018  
 – Several papers are mentioned. For example, one paper titled “Improving the Search for Architecture Knowledge in Online Developer Communities” is reported as a 2018 publication with a Paper Class that is characterized as evaluation research (and not as a personal experience, solution proposal, validation, opinion, or philosophical paper) [4].  
 – Also, “EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring” appears for 2018 with similar classification attributes (evaluation research set to True) [6].  
 – In addition, “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” is a 2018 work whose Classifications_2 is again detailed as evaluation research (with all other attributes as False) [11].  
 – “Using Informal Knowledge for Improving Software Quality Trade-Off Decisions” (2018) is described with the same overall Paper Class and associated properties [13].  
 – Lastly, “Providing Context as a Service Using Service-Oriented Mobile Indie Fog and Opportunistic Computing” is a 2018 paper whose Paper Class is characterized slightly differently (here evaluation research is False but validation research is True) [22].

• 2019  
 – There is a paper called “Aspect-Oriented Modeling of Technology Heterogeneity in Microservice Architecture” that was published in 2019 and is classified as a Paper Class described as evaluation research (with several negative attributes for other classifications) [7].  
 – Also, “An Architectural View for Data Protection by Design” (2019) is presented. Its Paper Class is detailed as not being evaluation research or opinion, personal experience, or philosophical yet is marked with proposal of solution and validation research as True [16].

• 2020  
 – The paper “COCOS: A Scalable Architecture for Containerized Heterogeneous Systems” (2020) is provided with a classification that is again labeled under Classifications_2 as a Paper Class (with evaluation research being True and the other attributes being False) [10].  
 – “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” (2020) is similarly reported with its Paper Class having evaluation research as True and the other properties set as False [20].  
 – “Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization” (2020) is explicitly mentioned as one of Mohamed Soliman’s publications. Its paper is assigned the Paper Class with evaluation research set to True and the remaining attributes (validation research, proposal of solution, opinion, philosophical, personal experience) set to False [21].

• 2021  
 – One set of texts indicates a 2021 paper with titles such as “Exploring Web Search Engines to Find Architectural Knowledge” (or closely related variants such as “Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces…” or “An Exploratory Study on Architectural Knowledge in Issue Tracking Systems”). This paper’s contribution is classified as Classifications_2 with its Paper Class characterized as evaluation research (and specifically not a personal experience, a solution proposal, validation research, opinion, or philosophical paper) [1], [2], [3].  
 – In another 2021 work—“FLRA: A Reference Architecture for Federated Learning Systems”—the paper class is detailed differently. Here, evaluation research is False, but the proposal of solution is True (and the other properties such as validation research, personal experience, opinion, and philosophical are False) [12].

Thus, if we assume that all these works (with their explicit Classifications_2 contributions) are by Mohamed Soliman, the overall distribution of his papers by publication year (with their associated “Paper Class” and detailed attributes as provided) is:

 • 2017: 1 paper  
 • 2018: 5 papers  
 • 2019: 2 papers  
 • 2020: 3 papers  
 • 2021: 2 papers

Each paper is associated with a contribution labeled “Classifications_2” (the so‐called “Paper Class”), with most papers exhibiting evaluation research as the main attribute—except in some cases (for example, “FLRA: A Reference Architecture for Federated Learning Systems” and “An Architectural View for Data Protection by Design”) where the paper class also includes a solution proposal and validation research attribute.

One source [1] indicates that confirmability, construct validity, and repeatability are marked as false, while external and internal validity are noted as true. In contrast, other sources [2], [3], and [4] report that all five aspects are flagged as false. Additionally, source [5] describes a similar set of threats but specifies that while confirmability, construct validity, internal validity, and external validity are false, repeatability is marked as true. These sources, therefore, differ in the reported evaluation of internal/external validity and repeatability, but they consistently identify all five aspects as the threats to validity discussed in the paper.

Confirmability is indicated as False, meaning that the study’s findings cannot be easily confirmed by others. Construct validity is marked as True, suggesting that the measures used in the study effectively capture the concepts intended to be measured. Internal validity is reported as False, indicating potential issues with causal inferences within the study. Repeatability is also noted as False, implying that repeating the study might not yield the same results. Finally, external validity is confirmed as True, which suggests that the findings can be generalized to other contexts [1][2].

Its evaluation involved assessing properties such as Functional Suitability (and, in one instance, Product Quality) on a Research Object, and it was noted that tool support was employed (even though no actual tool support was available) and no guideline was used.

On the other hand, source [2] states that the paper ""Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures"" was evaluated by applying an Evaluation Method from an Evaluation Method List. Specifically, one of the evaluation methods used was “Grounded Theory” and the evaluation included the property “Limit of detection.”

Thus, while the resiliency patterns paper used a Technical Experiment with evaluations focused on selected quality properties, the architectural decision making paper was evaluated using a Grounded Theory approach with its own set of evaluation characteristics.

Furthermore, this study employs an evaluation method list featuring a Case Study approach and notes a Threat to Validity with repeatability explicitly marked as False. In contrast, the evaluation details provided for ""Integrating Statistical Response Time Models in Architectural Performance Models"" focus on a different framework. According to another set of sources [2], this research is evaluated using a property related to Performance Efficiency, and an evaluation method list that specifies a Technical Experiment. Additionally, it includes aspects such as the Has Guideline property (set to False), tool support (also False), confirmation of input data usage (True), and a similar Threat to Validity concern regarding repeatability (False).

Thus, the key difference between the two evaluations is that the blockchain-based study [1] is assessed via a structured evaluation involving a Case Study approach with explicit properties (such as Functional Suitability, Product Quality, and Security), while ""Integrating Statistical Response Time Models in Architectural Performance Models"" [2] employs an evaluation method based on a Technical Experiment that incorporates performance efficiency properties and additional guideline and tool support attributes.

One source [1] states that “Architecture-Based Change Impact Analysis in Information Systems and Business Processes” is explicitly linked to a paper class defined by attributes such as not being a philosophical paper and not proposing a solution. However, this same source does not provide explicit information about the paper class for “How Software Architects Focus Their Attention.” In contrast, another source [2] indicates that “How Software Architects Focus Their Attention” is explicitly associated with a contribution labeled as Classifications_2, which falls under the Paper Class, while it does not specify the paper class details for “Architecture-Based Change Impact Analysis in Information Systems and Business Processes.” 

Thus, the combined answer is that each paper is tied to a different description within the Paper Class: “How Software Architects Focus Their Attention” is connected to a classification contribution (Classifications_2) [2], whereas “Architecture-Based Change Impact Analysis in Information Systems and Business Processes” is linked to a set of attributes defining its paper class [1].

• [1] indicates that “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” is explicitly associated with the paper class known simply as “Paper Class” (as referenced in several texts). However, [2] counters that there is no corresponding explicit information provided for this paper’s class.

• In contrast, [2] and [3] clarify that “Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” is categorized under Classifications_2. This classification is defined as a Paper Class characterized by evaluation research (and it is explicitly not a philosophical paper, personal experience paper, opinion article, validation research paper, or merely a proposal of a solution).

In summary, while the texts clearly describe the characteristics of the Paper Class (evaluation research, etc.) as applied within the provided context—with “Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” being associated with this classification—there is no fully unambiguous or equivalent explicit statement concerning the paper class for “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” other than the initial claim mentioned in [1]. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

“‘Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution’ is associated with the Paper Class defined under Classifications_2 (characterized as evaluation research and excluding other types such as philosophical or validation research), while the provided texts do not consistently offer explicit information on the paper class for ‘From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach’ despite an initial claim to its association with the ‘Paper Class’ [1,2,3].”

• In 2017, several papers were mentioned. For example, one paper explicitly from 2017 investigates a research object classified as Classifications_2 ([2], [3], [7], [12]).  
• In 2018, multiple papers also appear. These include investigations of research objects (again typically denoted as Classifications_2) in several contexts ([1], [4], [6], [8]).  
• In 2019, the research objects are again featured. At least three separate pieces were published in 2019, each investigating a research object ([9], [10], [13]).  
• In 2020, there are at least two papers that describe investigations of research objects, with one paper focusing on detailed evaluation properties and another including additional entities as part of a research object list ([11], [14]).  
• Finally, in 2021 a single paper is noted that contributes to the research objects investigated by Klym Shumaiev ([5]).  

Thus, according to the available texts, the objects of research are distributed across the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.

In what follows each result is accompanied by its source reference.

• In 2017 one paper is reported as having applied three evaluation methods. For example, the paper “Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud‐Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks” is described as evaluating its approach using three methods (Technical Experiment, Motivating Example, and Argumentation) [6]. (Another text [3] also reports three evaluation methods for a 2017 study.)  

• In 2018, at least one paper (for example, “Improving the Search for Architecture Knowledge in Online Developer Communities”) is reported as having two evaluation methods (Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment) [14]. Other texts for 2018 (such as those for “Migrating Towards Microservice Architectures: An Industrial Survey” and “Data‑Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures”) similarly report the use of two evaluation methods [11,12].

• In 2019 the reported paper (for example, “An Exploratory Study of Naturalistic Decision Making in Complex Software Architecture Environments”) applied two evaluation methods (Focus Group and Questionnaire) [9]. (Other texts for 2019, for example [21] and [25], also mention a pair of methods for works attributed to Mauro Caporuscio.)

• In 2020 several papers by Mauro Caporuscio are described. For instance:
 – The work “Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly” used one evaluation method (Technical Experiment) [1].  
 – “Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization” applied one evaluation method (Case Study) [4].  
 – “Model‑Based Analysis of Microservice Resiliency Patterns” applied one evaluation method (Technical Experiment) [10].  
 – “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions” is reported to have used two evaluation methods (Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment) [13].  
 – “Architectural Patterns for Cross‑Domain Personalised Automotive Functions” applied two evaluation methods (Technical Experiment and Argumentation) [17].  
 – “Data Stream Operations as First‑Class Entities in Component‑Based Performance Models” applied one evaluation method (Case Study) [20].  
 – “Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis” applied two evaluation methods (Questionnaire and Case Study) [22].  
 – “Butterfly Space: An Architectural Approach for Investigating Performance Issues” applied one evaluation method (Case Study) [23].  

• In 2021, works attributed to Mauro Caporuscio include:  
 – “A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures” using one evaluation method (Technical Experiment) [2].  
 – Another 2021 paper is reported as using two evaluation methods (Focus Group and Interview) [5].  
 – “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” applied two evaluation methods (Technical Experiment and Questionnaire) [19].  
 – “ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns” applied one evaluation method (Technical Experiment) [26].

In summary, according to the texts provided the papers by Mauro Caporuscio have the following evaluation-method counts by publication year:  

 • 2017 – Three evaluation methods in at least one paper  
 • 2018 – Two evaluation methods in at least one paper  
 • 2019 – Two evaluation methods in at least one paper  
 • 2020 – Depending on the paper, either one or two evaluation methods are applied  
 • 2021 – Depending on the paper, either one or two evaluation methods are applied

Each source ([1] through [26]) provided explicit details for one or more works. The answer above reflects those reported counts for the works attributed to Mauro Caporuscio.

Note that different papers from the same publication year report differing numbers of evaluation approaches. For example, in 2017 some texts describe a paper with three evaluation approaches ([1], [2], [7], [27]), while another text reports a paper with six approaches ([10]). Similarly, for other years the counts differ across the papers available in the texts. The details are as follows:

• 2017  
 – One group of texts reports that a paper published in 2017 applied three evaluation approaches (for example, Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview as in [1] or Technical Experiment, Questionnaire, and Controlled Experiment as in [2]). Other texts report that a paper applied three evaluation approaches (e.g. Technical Experiment, Motivating Example, and Argumentation as in [7] or Verification, Technical Experiment, and Architecture Analysis Method as in [27]). In addition, one source reports that a paper in 2017 applied six distinct approaches (including Benchmark, Technical Experiment, Performance efficiency, Quality of Method, Product Quality, and Accuracy as in [10]).  

• 2018  
 – One paper is described as having applied only one evaluation approach (a Case Study as in [3]). In contrast, several other texts report that the 2018 papers applied two evaluation approaches. For example, one paper uses Interview and Field Experiment ([9]); another paper uses Questionnaire and Case Study ([11]); still others report pairs such as Technical Experiment and Case Study ([12]), Interview and Questionnaire ([13]), Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment ([14]), or Motivating Example and Technical Experiment ([20]).  

• 2019  
 – Some texts report that a paper published in 2019 applied one evaluation approach (a Case Study as in [4] and [18], or Motivating Example as in [25]). Other papers in 2019 report two evaluation approaches (for example, Technical Experiment and Argumentation as in [17] or Focus Group and Questionnaire as in [21]). One text even reports a paper that applied four distinct evaluation approaches (Argumentation, Motivating Example, Portability, and Product Quality as in [26]).  

• 2020  
 – Among the papers published in 2020, one paper is reported as having applied one evaluation approach (a Focus Group as in [6] or a Case Study as in [24]). In other cases, papers are reported as having applied two evaluation approaches. For instance, one paper used Technical Experiment and Argumentation ([19]), another used Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment ([22]), and yet others report the pair Argumentation with Technical Experiment ([23]) or Argumentation with Controlled Experiment ([28]).  

• 2021  
 – For 2021, the texts include papers reported with one evaluation approach (Technical Experiment as in [5] or Motivating Example as in [15]) and papers reported with two evaluation approaches (for example, Technical Experiment and Questionnaire as in [8] or Focus Group and Interview as in [16]).  

Thus, based solely on the provided texts and without adding external interpretation, the evidence shows that for papers published by Danny Weyns:  

• In 2017, evaluation approaches applied ranged between 3 and 6 (depending on the paper).  
• In 2018, evaluation approaches applied were either 1 or 2.  
• In 2019, evaluation approaches applied ranged from 1, 2, and up to 4.  
• In 2020, evaluation approaches applied were either 1 or 2.  
• In 2021, evaluation approaches applied were either 1 or 2.  

This synthesis reflects the disparate counts provided in the texts ([1] through [28]).

For example:

• One publication explicitly noted in [1] is “Architecture‑Centric Support for Integrating Security Tools in a Security Orchestration Platform” which, besides evaluating the property “Functional Suitability,” provides evidence showing that input data is available.

• Similarly, the work “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” is reported in [4] to have its evaluation include the property “Functional Suitability” and to be linked to evidence that uses input data marked as available.

• “Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems” is mentioned in [7] as having its contribution evaluated with “Functional Suitability” alongside evidence that indicates at least some input data is available.

• In [16], “Determination and Enforcement of Least-Privilege Architecture in Android” is described as assessing functional suitability and explicitly providing available input data.

• The publication “From a Monolith to a Microservices Architecture: An Approach Based on Transactional Contexts” is highlighted in [20] as not only evaluating functional suitability but also having evidence where the input data is available.

• Furthermore, “InMap: Automated Interactive Code-to-Architecture Mapping Recommendations” ([24]) is noted to include an evaluation with the “Functional Suitability” property and at least one description explicitly states that its evidence uses input data (with a True flag).

• Finally, “Optimising Architectures for Performance, Cost, and Security” is mentioned in [25] as assessing functional suitability and, in at least one account, having input data that is available.

Thus, based solely on the provided texts the publications that meet both conditions are:  
– “Architecture‑Centric Support for Integrating Security Tools in a Security Orchestration Platform” [1]  
– “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” [4]  
– “Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems” [7]  
– “Determination and Enforcement of Least-Privilege Architecture in Android” [16]  
– “From a Monolith to a Microservices Architecture: An Approach Based on Transactional Contexts” [20]  
– “InMap: Automated Interactive Code-to-Architecture Mapping Recommendations” [24]  
– “Optimising Architectures for Performance, Cost, and Security” [25]

Each of these publications is described as including an evaluation where “Functional Suitability” is assessed, and at least one source explicitly indicates that their supporting evidence uses input data that is available.

• One paper is identified in [2].  
• One paper is identified in [3].  
• One paper is identified in [4].  
• One paper is identified in [5].  
• One paper is identified in [7].  
• One paper is identified in [8].  
• One paper is identified in [9].  
• One paper is identified in [15].

When we combine these counts, eight papers meet the stated criteria.  

For the remaining partial answers ([1], [6], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [16], [17], [18]), while they indicate that a paper may discuss repeatability as a validity threat, they do not provide explicit evidence that interviews were used in the evaluation. 

Thus, the overall conclusion from the provided texts is that eight papers that discuss repeatability as a validity threat use interviews in their evaluation.

Overall, the bulk of the evidence shows that although confirmability is discussed as a validity threat in some publications, none of the provided texts report a publication in which focus groups are employed for evaluation.

Therefore, there are 0 publications meeting both conditions.

• The 2018 study “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” also evaluates compatibility, and since it is the only other study that does so, it is the earliest publication among the studies explicitly addressing compatibility [1].

Thus, when sorted from most recent to earliest, the list is:

1. “Mitigating the Influence of Embedded Software Development Environments and Toolsets (ESDT) on Software Architecture” (2019) [2]  
2. “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” (2018) [1]

The other studies mentioned (from texts [3], [4], and [5]) either involve evaluation aspects that may relate to compatibility or focus on other evaluation properties, but they do not explicitly state that they evaluate compatibility.

• [2] states that “Formal Software Architectural Migration Towards Emerging Architectural Styles” applies a benchmark in its evaluation.

• [3] indicates that “Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multi-level Greedy Modularity Clustering for Software Architecture Recovery” applies a benchmark in its evaluation.

• [4] reports that “Employment of Optimal Approximations on Apache Hadoop Checkpoint Technique for Performance Improvements” applies a benchmark in its evaluation.

It should be noted that none of the partial answers provide explicit publication dates or additional temporal details for the papers (aside from the default assumption made in [1]), so while [1] is ranked as the most recent by default, no further ranking from most recent to oldest can be definitively determined based on the available information.

The individual pieces of evidence from the various sources mostly point toward multiple indications (typically two) showing that the paper did not use or make available its input data as compared to one indication in which the paper did have—and use—its input data. For example, sources [2], [3], [4], and [6] consistently describe a situation where two evidences indicate that the input data was not used (or was not available) versus one evidence showing that it was used (implying that it was made available), while sources [1] and [5] offer a slightly different count but still highlight the presence of conflicting details within the same paper. In summary, among the papers (in this case, a single paper) applying Data Science, there are overall more indications (typically two) of not using input data compared to one indication of making it available [1][2][3][4][5][6][7].

However, its evaluation evidence is described with conflicting indications regarding the public availability of its input data. For example, one source [1] suggests that the publication’s input data is publicly available, resulting in a count of one paper with publicly available input data and none without. In contrast, several other sources ([2], [3], [7], [10], [11], [12]) describe the evidence for the same publication in more detail. They indicate that while one instance shows the input data as publicly available, two instances show it as not publicly available. In summary, if one counts individual evidence instances, the overall picture is one instance of publicly available input data versus two instances where it is not. Thus, while there is only a single publication using Grounded Theory, its evaluation evidence is ambiguous—with conflicting indicators showing one “instance” of public availability against two “instances” of non-availability [1], [2], [3], [7], [10], [11], [12].

Some sources report that when considering papers on Architecture Design Method, only one paper’s evaluation dealt with Usability with no evidence of any evaluation of Portability ([2], [3], [4], [6], [10], [11], [12]). In contrast, other sources indicate that one paper evaluated Portability with no corresponding evaluation of Usability ([1], [7]) or even that one paper evaluated both ([5], [8]). One source ([9]) goes further by mentioning two evaluations of Portability and none for Usability.

Thus, depending on which extracts are taken into account, the reported counts differ. One cluster of texts shows that among the relevant papers one instance of evaluating Usability exists while no instance of evaluating Portability was reported; other texts report one (or even two) instances of Portability being evaluated (with either no or a matching single instance for Usability). 

In summary, the provided texts offer conflicting information:
 • Some partial answers indicate that 0 papers evaluated Portability while 1 paper evaluated Usability.
 • Other partial answers claim that 1 paper (or 2 instances) evaluated Portability, with either none or 1 paper evaluating Usability.
 • One source even reports that a single paper evaluated both properties.

Because the texts do not agree, no unique, unambiguous count can be derived without additional clarification.

• One paper in [1] includes an evaluation of both usability and portability.  
• One paper in [9] evaluates two properties—one related to usability and one to portability.  

In addition, a number of papers focus exclusively on usability (as noted in [2], [5], [7], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], and [16]), whereas several papers focus exclusively on portability (as noted in [3], [4], and [6]).

If each explicit focus counts as one instance, then there are 11 instances where the focus is on usability alone, and 2 instances (from [1] and [9]) where usability is also addressed alongside portability; this gives 13 instances addressing usability in total. In contrast, there are 3 instances focused exclusively on portability plus the 2 dual-focus instances ([1] and [9]), yielding 5 instances addressing portability in total.

Thus, among the papers that investigate a reference architecture, there are 13 instances focusing on usability compared to 5 instances focusing on portability [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16].

The citations in brackets indicate the source of each partial answer:

• “Employment of Optimal Approximations on Apache Hadoop Checkpoint Technique for Performance Improvements” – evidence in [1] shows that input data was not used.  
• “Modeling of Parametric Dependencies for Performance Prediction of Component-Based Software Systems at Run-Time” – several descriptions (including those in [2]) indicate that no input data was used.  
• “InMap: Automated Interactive Code-to-Architecture Mapping Recommendations” – as reported in [3], the associated evidence indicates that the input data is not available (i.e. not used).  
• “Semi-automatic Feedback for Improving Architecture Conformance to Microservice Patterns and Practices” – [4] reports that the contribution’s evidence marks input data as not used.  
• “Quantitative Verification-Aided Machine Learning: A Tandem Approach for Architecting Self-Adaptive IoT Systems” – [5] indicates that even though input data is mentioned, it is effectively marked as unavailable.  
• “Applying Architecture‐Based Adaptation to Automate the Management of Internet‐of‐Things” – despite a conflicting note, one piece of evidence in [6] explicitly shows that no input data was used.  
• “Dynamic Updates of Virtual PLCs Deployed as Kubernetes Microservices” – [7] reports that the evidence shows the input data attribute is set to False.  
• “EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring” – according to [8] the evidence explicitly indicates that no input data was used.  
• “Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns” – [9] gives two clear statements that the input data is not used.  
• “Workload-Based Clustering of Coherent Feature Sets in Microservice Architectures” – [10] explains explicitly that the evidence shows no usage of input data.  
• “Explaining Architectural Design Tradeoff Spaces: A Machine Learning Approach” – even though one description contradicts, [11] contains at least two statements indicating that the input data was not used.  
• “Optimising Architectures for Performance, Cost, and Security” – [12] indicates that input data was not used.  
• “A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures” – [13] presents evidence (despite a conflicting note) that the input data is marked as not used.  
• “IAS: An IoT Architectural Self-adaptation Framework” – [14] shows that in at least one instance the input data is indicated as not used.  
• “An Architecture-Driven Adaptation Approach for Big Data Cyber Security Analytics” – [15] clearly states that the input data is not used.  
• “ADOOPLA – Combining Product‐Line‐ and Product‐Level Criteria in Multi‐objective Optimization of Product Line Architectures” – [16] indicates through multiple evidence passages that no input data was used (despite one conflicting instance).  
• “ACE: Easy Deployment of Field Optimization Experiments” – [17] reports that its evidence explicitly flags the input data as not used.

Each of these papers investigates the research object “Architecture Optimization Method” and, based on the provided evidence, signals that no input data was used.

Several papers that are linked with architecture evolution are described with conflicting evidence regarding input data usage. For example, texts [1], [2], [3], [4], [7], [10], [11], [14], and others each indicate within different fragments that input data was sometimes marked as “False” (or not used) but in at least one instance it is also indicated as “True” (or used). Notably:

• Text [1] shows that one work is marked as not using input data from some sources, yet conflicting information appears (e.g., text [3]).  
• Text [5] clearly states that the paper “An Empirical Study of Architectural Decay in Open-Source Software” used input data, leaving no candidate in that case.  
• Texts [14] and [15] demonstrate that even when a paper investigating architecture evolution exists, all available descriptions include some evidence of using input data.

Given these contradictions, none of the papers investigating architecture evolution have been consistently and unambiguously reported as not using input data [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [10], [11], [14], [15].

Each candidate paper is reported only when its evaluation clearly uses a controlled (or technical) experiment and at least two explicit descriptions indicate that input data are not available (even if one description sometimes conflicts):

• “Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared” is evaluated by a controlled experiment and—according to multiple texts—has no input data available [1].  
• “On the Understandability of Semantic Constraints for Behavioral Software Architecture Compliance: A Controlled Experiment” applies a controlled experiment and is noted as not employing any input data [2].  
• “REST vs GraphQL: A Controlled Experiment” is stated to use a controlled experiment, and although one source conflicts, another explicitly reports that input data is not available [3].  
• “Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games” is evaluated using a controlled experiment and is supported by evidence showing that no input data are available [4].  
• “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions” is described as using a controlled experiment; at least one explicit description indicates that the evidence employs no input data (despite one conflicting note) [6].  
• “Mitigating the Influence of Embedded Software Development Environments and Toolsets (ESDT) on Software Architecture” employs a technical experiment (interpretable as a controlled experiment) and the available evidence indicates no input data is used [7].  
• “A Flexible Architecture for Key Performance Indicators Assessment in Smart Cities” applies a technical (controlled) experiment and—according to some texts—has no available input data (noting that one text conflicts) [9].  
• “Testing the Implementation of Concurrent AUTOSAR Drivers Against Architecture Decisions” is evaluated by a technical experiment and, while one description conflicts, at least two state that input data are not available [10].  
• “Synthesis and Quantitative Verification of Tradeoff Spaces for Families of Software Systems” is reported to use a technical experiment and at least two texts note that input data are not available [11].  
• “Quantitative Verification-Aided Machine Learning: A Tandem Approach for Architecting Self-Adaptive IoT Systems” applies a technical experiment and is documented as not having any input data available [12].  
• “A Goal-Driven Approach for Deploying Self-Adaptive IoT Systems” is evaluated via a technical experiment and evidence indicates that input data are not available [13].  
• “Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” is evaluated by a technical experiment with most texts explicitly stating that input data is not available [14].  
• “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” applies a technical experiment and does not have any input data available [15].  
• “A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures” was evaluated using a technical experiment and its input data is noted as not used (i.e. not available) [16].  
• “Architectural Patterns for Cross-Domain Personalised Automotive Functions” applies a technical experiment and, based on several texts, the input data is not available [18].  
• “Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly” is evaluated with a Technical Experiment and the evidence shows that input data are not available [19].  
• “Designing Robust Software Systems through Parametric Markov Chain Synthesis” uses a controlled experiment and its evidence reports that input data are not available [20].  
• “Component-Based Refinement and Verification of Information‐Flow Security Policies for Cyber‐Physical Microservice Architectures” applies a technical experiment and is supported by explicit statements that no input data are available [21].  
• “Mapping Features to Source Code through Product Line Architecture: Traceability and Conformance” is evaluated using a technical experiment and – based on multiple descriptions – input data are not available (despite one conflicting mention) [23].

The above list excludes the paper “Improving the Search for Architecture Knowledge in Online Developer Communities” because its evidence does include input data and excludes those contributions where more than one source clearly contradicts the “no input data available” criterion.

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, the papers that apply a controlled experiment (or technical experiment) and do not have any input data available are the ones listed with sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [18], [19], [20], [21], and [23].

In these instances, evaluations that include a property—with one sub-property being Reliability—are associated with this paper classification. Therefore, when papers investigate the property Reliability, they are most frequently classified under ""Paper Class.""

It is important to note that some texts ([6], [7], [8], and [9]) point out that while the paper is indeed categorized as ""Paper Class"" via Classifications_2, there is no explicit statement directly linking the investigation of Reliability to this classification. However, the overall trend across the texts indicates that ""Paper Class"" is the only paper class mentioned, leading to the conclusion that when papers investigate the property Reliability, they are most frequently classified as ""Paper Class.""

Thus, while not every contribution explicitly mentions “Architecture Description” (or its close variants) as the research object, the consistent classification for papers employing the Case Study evaluation method is “Paper Class.”

For example, one paper was noted in 2017 ([1], [7], [18]), one paper in 2018 ([3], [4], [5], [14], [19]), one paper in 2019 ([2], [9], [13], [15], [16]), one in 2020 ([8], [17]), and one in 2021 ([6], [10], [11], [12]). However, the texts do not offer any aggregated or comparative data that would allow us to determine a definitive or consistent annual publication frequency beyond these isolated instances. In summary, while we can identify single instances for several years, there is no broader frequency trend provided across all texts.

• Another paper, ACE: Easy Deployment of Field Optimization Experiments, also employed a field experiment and was published in 2019 [3].  
• Additionally, “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” is noted as employing a field experiment; however, no publication year or additional frequency breakdown over time is provided for this work [1].

Thus, the explicit information indicates one paper in 2017 and one paper in 2019 that used a field experiment, with no further details available for other years.

It is important to note that while several papers make explicit mention of investigating reliability through the evaluation process of Classifications_2, many other papers evaluate Classifications_2 on various other properties (such as Performance efficiency, Quality in Use, and Product Quality) without an explicit focus on reliability [2], [4], [5], [6], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15].

Thus, the research object that is central to these papers is Classifications_2, with some studies specifically evaluating its reliability, while others focus on different evaluation aspects.

Multiple sources explicitly state the use of a Technical Experiment ([1], [2], [6], [8], [10], [14], [20], [22], [26], [28]). In several instances, a Questionnaire is used as well ([1], [3], [6], [7], [17], [23], [24]). Some texts indicate the use of Controlled Experiment ([1], [11], [15], [20]). Other methods include Focus Group ([3], [12], [16], [17]) and Interview ([3], [7], [16], [18]). Additionally, the texts mention Argumentation as an evaluation method ([4], [10], [13], [25]). A Verification method is reported in one instance ([5]). 

Moreover, some sources refer to Motivating Example ([8], [21], [25]) and Case Study ([9], [22], [23], [24], [27], [29], [30]) as the evaluation methods employed. In one description, Field Experiment appears as the method used ([18]) and Benchmark is mentioned in another ([19]). Finally, a couple of texts present an evaluation method value of “False” ([26], [30]), which could either indicate a flag or a lack of an alternative method.

In summary, the papers evaluating compatibility describe a range of evaluation methods – including Technical Experiment, Questionnaire, Controlled Experiment, Focus Group, Interview, Argumentation, Verification, Motivating Example, Case Study, Field Experiment, and Benchmark – with a note that in some cases “False” is provided as an evaluation method value ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]).

One text mentions general evaluation methods without specifying a direct connection to Freedom from Risk [1]. In contrast, another text names Focus Group and Interview as part of the evaluation methods used in the study, implying that these two methods are employed in the overall evaluation process that includes Freedom from Risk [2]. 

Thus, while the connection to Freedom from Risk is not made explicit, two different evaluation methods (Focus Group and Interview) are mentioned in relation to the study.

Some texts state that only one evaluation method is explicitly applied (see [1], [3], [4], [12], [16], [17], [19], [22], [28], [30]). In contrast, a larger group of texts indicate that two distinct evaluation methods are applied (see [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [13], [14], [15], [18], [20], [21], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [29]). In addition, a couple of texts mention three evaluation methods (see [2] and [6]). 

Thus, although there is some conflicting information, the majority of the provided sources identify two different evaluation methods as being applied in the evaluation process that includes the property of reliability.

Several papers mention an evaluation that involves the property Reliability, but the identified research objects vary depending on the text. For example, one source [1] talks about simply “Research Object” being evaluated regarding Reliability, while another source [2] identifies “Classifications_2” as the research object under evaluation. In addition, another text [3] mentions two research objects in relevant contexts—“Research Object” (as seen in [1]) and “Architecture Analysis Method”—and yet another source [5] links the evaluation of Reliability to the research object named “A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing.” Furthermore, source [4] corroborates the identification of “Classifications_2” as the research object evaluated with the Reliability property.

When combining these mentions and ranking the research object names in descending alphabetical order (using only the names as given), we have the following objects to order:
• Research Object  
• Classifications_2  
• Architecture Analysis Method  
• A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing

Sorting in descending alphabetical order means that names starting with later letters in the alphabet come first. In this case:
• “Research Object” (starting with R, later than C or A)  
• “Classifications_2” (starting with C)  
• “Architecture Analysis Method” (starting with A, and “Architecture…” comes later alphabetically than “A Comparison…” due to the character following “A”)  
• “A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing” (starting with A, but ranking after “Architecture Analysis Method”)

Thus, the final descending alphabetical ranking of the research objects evaluated regarding the property Reliability is as follows:

1. Research Object [1], [3]  
2. Classifications_2 [2], [4]  
3. Architecture Analysis Method [3]  
4. A Comparison of MQTT Brokers for Distributed IoT Edge Computing [5]

Several publications that include an evaluation of compatibility do so by applying the evaluation to one or more “research objects” – with some texts considering a single research object and others explicitly distinguishing between a generic research object (frequently contributed as “Classifications_2” or simply “Research Object”) and a research object found as part of a list (with a named entity such as “Reference Architecture”, “Architecture Decision Making”, “Architecture Extraction”, “Architecture Evolution”, “Architectural Assumptions”, “Architecture Analysis Method”, “Architecture Design Method”, “Architecture Description”, or “Architecture Optimization Method”). For example:

• Sources [1], [3], [7], [13], [15], and [17] note that the evaluation is applied to a generic research object (or one contributed as “Classifications_2”), with some texts also indicating that this research object appears within a research object list that supplies a separate named entity.  
• Sources [12] and [25] explicitly present both a generic “Research Object” and a “Research Object List” (from which an entity is drawn) as the evaluation targets. When these two are ranked in descending alphabetical order the order becomes:  
  “Research Object List”, “Research Object”.  
• In other instances (for example, [2], [10], [11], [16], [20], [23], [26], [27] and [28]) the evaluation is said to be applied on two research objects—one being the research object contributed as “Classifications_2” (or its synonym “Research Object”) and the other being a named entity (such as “Architecture Evolution”, “Reference Architecture”, “Architecture Decision Making”, “Architecture Extraction”, “Architecture Design Method”, etc.). Depending on the specific study the descending‐alphabetical ranking among the two objects varies. For instance, in [3] and [13] the two objects (“Research Object” and “Reference Architecture”) are ranked as:  
  Research Object, Reference Architecture  
where the “R” of Research Object comes after “R” of Reference Architecture in descending order; and in [28] a three‐object ranking is given as:  
  Classifications_2, Architecture Design Method, Architecture Description  
since the descending order is determined by comparing the names letter‐by‐letter.

Thus, one coherent aggregated answer is to distinguish that among the publications evaluating compatibility the evaluation is applied on (a) a generic research object (often contributed as “Classifications_2”) and (b) on a second object that comes from a research object list. When considering those two broad kinds, if we rank them in descending alphabetical order we obtain: 

  Research Object List, Research Object        [12], [25]

It is worth noting that some studies offer additional distinctions—and when ranked, those specific pairs (or triples) appear with descending‐alphabetical order that may, for example, be “Classifications_2” followed by “Architecture Evolution” ([2], [11]) or “Research Object” followed by “Reference Architecture” ([3], [13], [17]). 

In summary, the publications that investigate compatibility apply their evaluation on research objects which (depending on the study) may be either:  
 • A generic research object (often contributed as “Classifications_2” or referred to simply as “Research Object”), or  
 • A research object from within a research object list (with a specific name such as “Reference Architecture”, “Architecture Decision Making”, etc.).  

When we use the two‐group framework (i.e. generic Research Object vs. Research Object List) and rank them in descending alphabetical order, the final answer is:  

  Research Object List, Research Object.

Some texts indicate that in one instance involving Architecture Evolution the property Satisfaction is explicitly evaluated while Context coverage is either not mentioned at all [1, 11, 14, 15, 16] or is evaluated only once in a different instance [5, 6, 12]. Other texts point out that although one paper might show one instance of each property being evaluated [5, 6], that evidence is not clearly linked to papers on Architecture Evolution [2, 8, 10, 12]. In summary, the available evidence shows that in some instances Satisfaction is explicitly evaluated (with at least one mention, and even two in one study [7, 10]), whereas Context coverage is either evaluated once or not mentioned at all when Architecture Evolution is the research object. Thus, based on the provided information there is no clear indication of a consistent difference in frequency between the evaluation of Satisfaction and Context coverage in the context of Architecture Evolution [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

In some publications both properties are evaluated equally (once each), while in others there is a discrepancy or even an absence of one property compared to the other. For example, one publication shows that both “satisfaction” and “context coverage” are each evaluated once [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12]. In contrast, another publication indicates that while “context coverage” is evaluated once, “satisfaction” is referenced twice [2]. There are also several cases where only one of the properties is clearly mentioned. In some instances only “context coverage” is evaluated and there is no explicit mention of “satisfaction” [4, 10, 11, 15], whereas in other cases “satisfaction” is evaluated without any corresponding information on “context coverage” [13, 14, 16, 17, 18].

Thus, among the publications that investigate architecture patterns, the frequency with which “satisfaction” is evaluated relative to “context coverage” varies by study. Some studies show a one‐to‐one correspondence, one shows “satisfaction” evaluated more frequently, and other studies include the evaluation of only one of these properties.

• One source [1] indicates that in the evaluation process using the Case Study method, a property named “Maintainability” is explicitly evaluated, with no similar explicit evaluation mentioned for “Usability.”  
• In contrast, another source [2] states that an evaluation using the Case Study method did include a sub-property “Usability,” but does not provide any frequency information regarding “Maintainability.”  
• A third source [3] reinforces that “Maintainability” is explicitly evaluated using the Case Study method while there is no reference to any evaluation of “Usability.”

Thus, while Maintainability is explicitly evaluated (as noted in [1] and [3]), the information provided does not offer a consistent or comparable frequency for the evaluation of Usability. There is no clear indication that both properties are evaluated with the same frequency; in fact, explicit evaluation only for Maintainability is confirmed, whereas “Usability” either appears only in one account or not at all.

Several texts ([1], [2], [3], [4]) indicate that among publications that apply a controlled experiment in their evaluation, usability is explicitly evaluated while maintainability is not mentioned. In contrast, other partial answers ([5], [6], [7]) describe instances where both usability and maintainability are evaluated—each being evaluated once in a given publication. Yet another set of partial answers ([8], [9]) claim that maintainability is explicitly evaluated while usability is not mentioned at all.

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, the evaluation frequencies vary by publication. In some cases usability is evaluated (with maintainability not evaluated), in others maintainability is evaluated (without usability), and in yet other instances both properties are evaluated, each once.

• In one study on microservice boundaries, an evaluation conducted without a guideline assessed the properties Effectiveness, Satisfaction, Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, and Product Quality [1].  
• In another work (Recovering Architectural Design Decisions), the guideline‐free evaluation considered Functional Suitability, Effectiveness, Quality of Method, Quality in Use, Product Quality, and Accuracy [3].  
• A different publication (a Platform Architecture for Multi‐Tenant Blockchain‐Based Systems) was evaluated without a guideline, and this evaluation involved Performance efficiency, Product Quality, Quality in Use, and Functional Suitability [4].  
• Similarly, in an Aspect‐Oriented Modeling study, a guideline was not used when assessing Performance efficiency, Effectiveness, Quality in Use, Product Quality, and Functional Suitability [22].  
• Another example shows that in the evaluation of “Trace Link Recovery for Software Architecture Documentation” without a guideline, the properties Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, Effectiveness, Quality of Method, Product Quality, and Accuracy were examined [23].  
• Additional cases include evaluations that—without guideline adherence—addressed properties such as Reliability, Maintainability, Portability [6], Usability and Context coverage [17] or [24], and Accuracy and Quality of Method [29].  
• Finally, the study “REST vs GraphQL: A Controlled Experiment” shows that, aside from one instance where a guideline was used, properties such as Usability, Satisfaction, Quality in Use, Product Quality, and Efficiency have been evaluated in setups that did not explicitly detail guideline use [30].

In sum, among publications investigating architectural assumptions, several evaluations explicitly conducted without following a guideline have assessed various properties. These include, for example, Effectiveness, Satisfaction, Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, Product Quality, Quality of Method, Accuracy, Performance efficiency, Reliability, Maintainability, Portability, Usability, Context coverage, and Efficiency [1, 3, 4, 6, 17, 22, 23, 24, 29, 30].

For example, one publication (“Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures” [1]) clearly indicates that its evaluation of Classifications_2 was conducted without a guideline. Similarly, other texts (such as those in [2] and [3]) note that in the context of grounded theory the research object (Classifications_2) was evaluated with its “Has Guideline” property set to False. 

Thus, among publications that apply grounded theory in their evaluation, the research object evaluated without using a guideline is the one classified as Classifications_2.

One text explains that an Evaluation Method List for a Technical Debt study includes an entity named “Data Science” [1]. A second text, concerning the paper “Architectural Decay as Predictor of Issue- and Change-Proneness,” also indicates that the evaluation method used is Data Science [2]. Although another text mentions “Grounded Theory” for a study titled “Architectural Technical Debt: A Grounded Theory” [3], the overall evidence points to Data Science being mentioned more than once in the context of Technical Debt.

Several texts explicitly report that evaluation activities tend to examine these two properties, either directly by naming them or by refining one of them into a sub-property (see [1], [2], [5], [6], [7], [10], [18], [19], and [20]). Although some texts mention additional aspects such as maintainability, performance efficiency, evaluation methods, and validity (e.g., Threats To Validity with confirmability details), the only properties that are consistently and explicitly named in association with the research object are Functional Suitability and Product Quality.

In particular, Functional Suitability is mentioned several times as an evaluation criterion ([2], [5], [10], [11], [19]), and Product Quality is also explicitly evaluated on multiple occasions ([1], [2], [11], [19], [22], [26]). Therefore, it can be concluded that Functional Suitability and Product Quality have been the properties most often examined in these studies.

For example, one source [1] indicates that its evaluation includes a property called Quality in Use (with a sub‐property named Effectiveness), while several other sources [2], [3], [6], [9], [12], and [13] report that the evaluation involves properties such as Product Quality and Functional Suitability (with some texts also mentioning additional sub‐properties). Moreover, one context [16] explicitly refers to the evaluation property as Effectiveness. It is also worth noting that, although the question mentions the paper “Enabling Continuous Software Engineering for Embedded Systems Architectures with Virtual Prototypes,” none of the provided texts explicitly link that paper to one unique evaluation property.

In summary, based solely on the available texts, the Architecture Design Method is evaluated along various quality-related properties—most notably Quality in Use (with Effectiveness as a sub‐property), Product Quality, and Functional Suitability.

For instance, one paper evaluated the research object by employing Grounded Theory as its method ([1], [10]). In another study, Data Science was used as the evaluation method ([7]). Interview techniques were also applied, with one instance explicitly referring to Interview as the method ([11]) and another combining Interview with Focus Group methods ([14]). Moreover, Focus Groups were used as the evaluation method in a couple of studies ([14], [17], [19]), and one paper reported the use of a Controlled Experiment as its evaluation method ([16]). Additionally, one study detailed the utilization of a Questionnaire ([19]), and yet another paper adopted a Case Study approach ([22]). 

In summary, the explicitly stated evaluation methods applied by Uwe Zdun to investigate Architecture Decision Making are:  
• Grounded Theory  
• Data Science  
• Interview  
• Focus Group  
• Controlled Experiment  
• Questionnaire  
• Case Study  

Each of these methods was associated with evaluations of various properties (such as Satisfaction, Accuracy, Quality in Use, or Effectiveness) and sometimes accompanied by additional evaluation attributes (e.g., guideline settings). The combination of these methods reflects a multi-method approach used across his research contributions.

In fact, across Duc Le’s publications, accuracy is explicitly defined as an evaluation property while the overall evaluations employ various evaluation methods. For example, some contributions report using a Case Study approach (e.g., [1], [4], [7], [10], [14], [16], [24], [25], [30]) to assess a number of evaluation properties, with accuracy being one of them. Other papers report employing Benchmark methods (e.g., [2], [6], [11]) in which one of the examined properties is Accuracy. In addition, other evaluation approaches noted include Grounded Theory (as described in [3] and [22]) and Technical Experiment, which appears in several contributions (e.g., [5], [6], [8], [9], [13], [15], [17], [18], [20], [27], [28], [29]). Furthermore, at least one contribution employed a Data Science approach (see [12] and [26]) and another used a Focus Group method (see [23]), with Controlled Experiment also being mentioned alongside Technical Experiment in one instance ([19]). One source ([15]) additionally indicates that Argumentation was used as an evaluation method, though without a separate mechanism solely for assessing accuracy.

Thus, in Duc Le’s publications, accuracy is evaluated as an explicit property within broader evaluation processes that have employed one or more of the following methods: Case Study, Benchmark, Grounded Theory, Technical Experiment, Data Science, Focus Group, and Controlled Experiment (with additional mention of Argumentation in one case).

In several contributions, the usability‐related property “Quality in Use” (often alongside properties such as Functional Suitability, Effectiveness, Satisfaction, and even sub‐properties related to Maintainability and Performance Efficiency) is assessed using an evaluation method drawn from an Evaluation Method List. For instance, some works apply a Technical Experiment to evaluate usability [1], [3], [4], [8], [12], [16], and [18], whereas others make use of a Controlled Experiment approach [2], [9]. In addition to these experimental methods, Case Study methods have also been employed in order to assess usability—typically through a combination of quality properties like Quality in Use, Functional Suitability, and Satisfaction [5], [6], [10], [20], [21], [23], and [28]. 

Other evaluation methods mentioned include the Interview method, which was used to gauge usability aspects [7], [13], and [29], and a Questionnaire method specifically applied in one study [11]. In one work, usability was also approached indirectly via a Focus Group method that examined Quality in Use and Functional Suitability [25], [27]. Furthermore, the approach designated as the Motivating Example was utilized alongside an assessment of several properties linked to usability, such as Quality in Use, Functional Suitability, Maintainability, Effectiveness, and Performance efficiency [15]. Finally, there was also mention of an Architecture Analysis Method (in a context that combined it with a Case Study) [14] and the use of a Benchmark method in another case where several properties including Quality in Use, Effectiveness, Quality of Method, and Performance efficiency were measured [17].

Thus, to summarize, the usability of objects investigated in papers by Lu Xiao has been evaluated using multiple methods, including Technical Experiment, Controlled Experiment, Case Study, Interview, Questionnaire, Focus Group, Motivating Example, Architecture Analysis Method, and Benchmark—with the assessments frequently focused on usability-related properties such as Quality in Use, Functional Suitability, Effectiveness, Satisfaction, among others [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].

In some instances only one method is mentioned, whereas in others more than one name appears. For example, several passages explicitly state that an evaluation method entity named “Case Study” was used ([1], [3], [5], [10], [12], [14], [15], [19], [24], [28], [29]). Other texts explicitly indicate that the evaluation was performed using a method called “Technical Experiment” ([2], [4], [6], [7], [13], [18], [20], [26], [30]). In addition, there are texts which point to “Motivating Example” as the named evaluation method ([9], [11], [17], [22]). Finally, a couple of texts introduce further names—for example, “Grounded Theory” ([16]), “Controlled Experiment” ([25]), and even one mention of “Verification” (in combination with “Technical Experiment”) ([23]).

Thus, based solely on the explicit information provided:

• One branch of evaluations used the method “Case Study.”  
• Another branch relied on the “Technical Experiment” approach.  
• A further branch names “Motivating Example” as the evaluation method.  
• Additionally, single instances mention “Grounded Theory,” “Controlled Experiment,” and “Verification.”

It should be emphasized that while the texts describe several evaluation method entities in connection with the research object “Architecture Analysis Method,” none of them explicitly link these methods to Stephan Seifermann.

• Technical Experiment ([1], [5], [7], [9], [11], [12])  
• Case Study ([2], [4], [11])  
• Motivating Example ([5], [13])  
• Argumentation ([6], [8])  
• Controlled Experiment ([6], [7], [12])  
• Questionnaire ([7], [12])  
• Verification ([9])

This yields seven distinct evaluation methods applied in his papers that evaluate the property Efficiency.

For example, some sources state that only one evaluation method was applied ([1], [5], [13], [16], [17], [18], [21], [25], [30]), whereas others report that two methods were used ([2], [4], [6], [7], [9], [10], [14], [15], [20], [22], [23], [24], [26], [27], [28], [29]). There are even a few instances in which three different evaluation methods are named ([8], [11], [12]). 

Because the texts do not consistently link one unique count of evaluation methods specifically to the evaluation of property satisfaction by Georg Buchgeher, the overall answer remains ambiguous in the provided information.

For example, [1] and [6] mention “Grounded Theory” as the one method applied, while [5], [8], [13], [19], [22], and [23] single out methods such as “Case Study” without any indication of additional methods. Although a few sources ([2], [3], [7], [10], [11], [12], [14], [16], [18], [25], [27]) suggest the presence of two or more methods, these texts either do not directly connect the methods to Stefan Kugele’s evaluation of architecture patterns or offer conflicting counts. Thus, according to the texts that most clearly associate a single evaluation method with the context, the answer is that one evaluation method was applied [1][5][6][8][13][19][22][23].

Instead, different papers investigating Architecture Decision Making seem to have employed different evaluation methods. For example:

• One group of texts explicitly mentions a paper with two evaluation methods (e.g., Focus Group and Interview) [1].  
• Other texts describe studies that applied only one evaluation method (most often Interview, but also other methods such as Case Study, Focus Group, Data Science, Motivating Example, or even Grounded Theory) [2], [3], [5], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19].  
• Finally, one partial answer details a contribution where three evaluation methods (Technical Experiment, Motivating Example, and Argumentation) were applied [20].

Thus, the answer depends on which paper is under consideration. Ingo Weber’s work on Architecture Decision Making has seen evaluations applying one, two, or three methods depending on the specific study.

(Note that not every paper reports more than one evaluation method; many contributions investigated Architecture Evolution by using a single method.) The reported evaluation methods (with their relevant source citations) are as follows:

• Verification (reported in [22] alongside “Technical Experiment”)  
• Technical Experiment (reported in [3], [7], [14], [15], [21], and [22])  
• False (reported in [16])  
• Interview (reported in [4] and [10]—and also paired with Focus Group in [19])  
• Focus Group (reported in [19], [20], and [25])  
• Data Science (reported in [5] and [17])  
• Case Study (reported in [1], [2], [8], [9], [13], [18], and [23])  
• Questionnaire (reported in [4], [6], and [16] with an additional ranking in [25])  
• Controlled Experiment (reported in [11])  
• Architecture Analysis Method (reported in [21])  

Each entry is taken exactly from the provided sources with the method names as indicated there. This final list presents the set of evaluation methods in descending alphabetical order according to the constraints.

Note that the various texts reported different sets of property names; taking the union of all properties explicitly mentioned in relation to a technical experiment (with no additional external interpretation) yields the following list:

• Usability  
• Satisfaction  
• Robustness  
• Reliability  
• Quality of Method  
• Quality in Use  
• Performance efficiency  
• Product Quality  
• Maintainability  
• Functional Suitability  
• Effectiveness  
• Efficiency  
• Compatibility  
• Accuracy  

The ordering is determined by comparing the names alphabetically from Z to A. For example, “Usability” is first because U is the highest starting letter, and “Accuracy” is last because A is the lowest. 

This synthesis has combined the evaluations provided in the partial answers ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], and [30]).

Several texts indicate that a Technical Experiment was applied in the evaluation and—when considering the evaluation properties most frequently mentioned in connection with Andreas Burger’s work—the following three properties recur:

• Product Quality  
• Performance efficiency  
• Functional Suitability

For example, one partial answer states that these properties were employed—with descending alphabetical order being “Product Quality” followed by “Performance efficiency” and then “Functional Suitability” [1]. In a related text the Technical Experiment evaluation is said to include “Product Quality” and “Performance efficiency” [4], while another instance provides “Product Quality” and “Functional Suitability” [3]. In synthesizing these findings, the properties that have been investigated (and mentioned in multiple sources) are Product Quality, Performance efficiency, and Functional Suitability. When arranged in descending alphabetical order the list is:

  1. Product Quality  
  2. Performance efficiency  
  3. Functional Suitability

Thus, according to the provided information [1], [3], [4], the evaluation properties investigated by Andreas Burger using the Technical Experiment method are Product Quality, Performance efficiency, and Functional Suitability (in descending alphabetical order).

One text [4], however, cites a 2020 publication (""From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach"") in which a research object named “Architecture Extraction” is involved. In summary, most evidence suggests that the investigation of Architecture Extraction occurred in 2018 with no comparable instance in 2020, although there is one instance in 2020 mentioned in the texts.

On one hand, several sources indicate that an investigation related to architecture patterns was reported in 2020—with one instance noted—and that no investigation was mentioned for 2018 ([1], [2], [4], [7], [10], [11], [13], [16], [17], [20]). On the other hand, a different set of texts suggests that an investigation (or study) involving architecture patterns was reported in 2018—with one instance noted—and that no similar investigation is mentioned for 2020 ([3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [12], [14], [15], [18], [19], [21]). 

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, there is conflicting information: some sources report one investigation in 2020 with no corresponding investigation in 2018, while others report one investigation in 2018 with no corresponding investigation in 2020.

Several papers by Uwe Zdun report research objects whose evaluation is described only in terms of properties (or is explicitly marked as having “no guideline” or “False” for an evaluation method) without naming a method. In one group of sources the research objects appear simply as named entities in a Research Object List and no evaluation method is mentioned. For example, texts [1] (also confirmed in [3]) state that the research objects “Architecture Design Method” and “Architecture Description” are investigated without any evaluation method being applied. Other sources report similar omissions for entities that appear in lists. In particular, text [5] identifies two research objects—“Architecture Analysis Method” and “Architecture Extraction”—as not having any evaluation method applied. Text [4] explains that although the overall contribution “Classifications_2” is evaluated, one specific research object entity within that list—the one named “Architecture Pattern”—lacks an associated evaluation method.

Additional papers provide further instances. Text [8] mentions that within a contribution (again linked to a Classifications_2 contribution) the research objects represented by “Architecture Optimization Method” and “Architecture Analysis Method” do not have an evaluation method applied (with one instance even noting that the evaluation method field is “False”). Similarly, text [9] singles out a research object identified as “Reference Architecture” that is investigated without any indication of an evaluation method.

There are also other reports that—in describing the evaluation of a research object linked to a paper—mention an entity from a Research Object List with names such as “Architecture Decision Making,” “Architecture Description Language,” or “Architecture Evolution” that are presented without a named evaluation method ([22], [24], [25], [27], [21]). In one instance (text [15]), a paper on “Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games” is classified as a Paper Class not associated with evaluation research.

Finally, several texts (for example, [7], [12], [16], [23], [26] and [30]) note that the same overarching research object—commonly labeled “Classifications_2”—is evaluated in some instances using explicit methods (such as Focus Group, Interview, Technical Experiment or Questionnaire) while in other descriptions only evaluation properties are reported or the evaluation method is explicitly absent.

To summarize, according to the provided texts, the research objects investigated in Uwe Zdun’s papers for which no evaluation method has been applied include:

 • “Architecture Design Method” and “Architecture Description” ([1], [3]).  
 • “Architecture Pattern” (when it is part of a Research Object List within Classifications_2) ([4]).  
 • “Architecture Analysis Method” and “Architecture Extraction” ([5]; also noted in [8]).  
 • “Architecture Optimization Method” (again appearing in a research object list with no evaluation method) ([8]).  
 • “Reference Architecture” ([9]).  
 • Additionally, in some papers the overall contribution (commonly referred to as “Classifications_2”) is described in parts or via its sub-entities—such as “Architecture Decision Making,” “Architecture Description Language,” or “Architecture Evolution”—with no explicit evaluation method applied ([21], [22], [24], [25], [27]).  
 • In one case the contribution “Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games” is noted as a paper not associated with evaluation research ([15]).  
 • Finally, several instances of “Classifications_2” itself are reported without an explicitly applied evaluation method (even though in other instances it is evaluated using methods) ([7], [12], [16], [23], [26], [30]).

This answer reflects the range of research objects that were investigated in Uwe Zdun’s work but for which, at least in some descriptions, no evaluation method (in the sense of a formally named evaluation–for instance, Technical Experiment, Focus Group, etc.) was applied.

For example, one set of texts reports that a “Technical Experiment” was carried out without a guideline ([1], [10], [15], [30]). Other sources note that evaluations were performed using “Controlled Experiment” ([2], [3], [27]), “Case Study” ([4], [5], [9], [17], [23]), “Questionnaire” ([3], [19], [21], [29]) as well as methods such as “Focus Group” and “Interview” ([7], [11], [12], [21], [24], [26]). Yet some other texts indicate that the contributions were also evaluated by “Argumentation” ([8], [13], [14], [20]) and by “Motivating Example” ([10], [25], [28]), while additional methods mentioned (again with no guideline applied) include “Verification” ([16]), “Benchmark” ([22]), “Grounded Theory” ([6]), and “Field Experiment” ([26]). 

Thus, drawing on the provided sources, the evaluation methods used by Muhammad Babar that were not applied with an evaluation guideline include:  
• Technical Experiment  
• Controlled Experiment  
• Case Study  
• Questionnaire  
• Focus Group  
• Interview  
• Argumentation  
• Motivating Example  
• Verification  
• Benchmark  
• Grounded Theory  
• Field Experiment

Each of these methods appears in one or more texts where it is explicitly noted that the evaluation was conducted without an evaluation guideline.

Note that while not every source explicitly states the connection to his publications, several texts refer to contributions that are assumed to be his. The following methods have been reported in the provided texts:

1. Focus Group and Questionnaire  
 • In one instance, an evaluation method list explicitly mentioned the use of Focus Group and Questionnaire without a guideline ([1], [3], [21]). 

2. Technical Experiment  
 • One paper was evaluated using a Technical Experiment without a guideline ([2]).  
 • Other contributions (e.g. in Classifications_2 and “COCOS: A Scalable Architecture for Containerized Heterogeneous Systems”) also report the use of Technical Experiment without a guideline ([4], [7], [14], [26]).  
 • In addition, several texts note Technical Experiment in connection with evaluations performed without a guideline ([12], [16], [22], [29]). 

3. Controlled Experiment  
 • In one case the evaluation methods included both Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment, with at least one instance being executed without a guideline ([4], [7], [16]). 

4. Motivating Example  
 • At least one paper reported an evaluation using Motivating Example without a guideline ([6], [9], [12]). 

5. Argumentation  
 • Some texts note that an evaluation employed Argumentation without an associated guideline ([6], [10], [13], [24]). 

6. Case Study  
 • Evaluations in two different contributions used Case Study as the method without a guideline ([5], [8], [20], [28]). 

7. Interview and Field Experiment  
 • In one publication, the evaluation was carried out using Interview and Field Experiment without a guideline ([23]). 

8. Verification  
 • In one instance, Verification was applied along with Technical Experiment in an evaluation conducted without a guideline ([22]). 

9. Benchmark  
 • Benchmark was used in an evaluation that was carried out without a guideline in one paper ([17], [27]). 

10. Other approaches  
 • In one context an evaluation “for Quantum Computing Platforms” was described simply as an evaluation carried out without a guideline without further specifying another method ([19]).  
 • In another instance, additional evaluation aspects such as Accuracy and Quality of Method were mentioned alongside a Technical Experiment carried out without a guideline ([29]).

Summarizing, the evaluation methods applied without a guideline in papers associated with Johannes Grohmann include:  
• Focus Group  
• Questionnaire  
• Technical Experiment  
• Controlled Experiment  
• Motivating Example  
• Argumentation  
• Case Study  
• Interview  
• Field Experiment  
• Verification  
• Benchmark  
• (and in one case an evaluation approach without further method specification)

Various texts show that Classifications_2 is not only evaluated on properties like Functional Suitability, Product Quality, Quality of Method, Robustness, Performance efficiency, and similar evaluation aspects but is also further specified – in some cases by inclusion in research object lists with entities such as “Architecture Analysis Method,” “Architecture Design Method,” “Reference Architecture,” “Architectural Aspects,” “Architecture Evolution,” and others.

For example, several descriptions (e.g. in [1], [2], [5], [10], [11], [13], [19], [23], and [28]) clearly state that the evidence for Classifications_2 specifies that input data is not used. In contrast, although some texts also mention instances where input data is used (or marked as True), the question focuses only on those research objects evaluated without input data. In all these cases, the data points support the conclusion that the investigations concerned a single research object—Classifications_2—with evaluations and associated entities that, in the relevant instances, were carried out without the use of any input data.

Thus, the answer is: In the publications by Davide Arcelli, the research object investigated without using input data is the contribution identified as Classifications_2 (along with its various sub-entities such as “Architecture Analysis Method,” “Architecture Design Method,” “Reference Architecture,” etc.), where multiple evidence items explicitly indicate that input data was not employed [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], and [29].

For example, texts [1], [3], [5], [20], and [26] point out that one evaluation of the research object includes Functional Suitability (with additional detail provided through a sub‐property), and none of the other properties are emphasized with the same level of explicit detail. Although some other texts mention properties such as Performance efficiency, Accuracy, or Satisfaction, the explicit information that includes sub‐property characterization applies only to Functional Suitability. 

Therefore, the evidence from the provided texts indicates that Functional Suitability is the evaluation property most often featured in papers investigating architecture analysis methods by Romina Eramo.

Although a few texts mention other evaluation methods (for example, “Technical Experiment” [2], [8], [9], [13], [17], [22] or “Motivating Example” [2], [11], [12], [26]), these either relate to contributions that are not clearly described as proposing a solution or are not clearly linked to an investigated research object named “Architecture Extraction.”

In summary, among papers whose class is described as the proposal of solution, the evaluation method that has been most explicitly applied is “Case Study.” It is important to note that while the question refers to a research object called “Architecture Extraction,” the texts do not provide explicit evaluation details for that specific object.

In these sources the paper “Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization” (published in 2020) is described as having its evaluation performed via an Evaluation Method List that includes an Evaluation Method Entity named “Case Study.” No other texts provide a clear link between a specific evaluation method and a 2020 paper on architecture evolution or indicate that any other method was used more frequently in that year. 

Thus, the coherent conclusion from the provided information is that the most applied evaluation method for architecture evolution in a paper published in 2020 is “Case Study” [4][8].

• One research object is evaluated using Grounded Theory and was published in 2019 [3] [5].  
• Another research object explicitly evaluated with Grounded Theory was published in 2020 [1] [4].

No texts provide explicit information about research objects evaluated with Grounded Theory in 2021. 

Thus, the distribution of research objects evaluated with Grounded Theory during the period is that one was published in 2019 and one in 2020, with no such evaluation reported for 2021.

Although not every source covers the full period or addresses “compatibility” explicitly, the following distribution can be discerned from the provided information:

• For publications published in 2017, several sources indicate that a broad spectrum of evaluation methods were applied. For example, one publication used Technical Experiment, Questionnaire, and Controlled Experiment ([2]), another applied Technical Experiment, Motivating Example, Argumentation, and even incorporated an aspect described as Functional Suitability ([5]). Additional publications from 2017 show methods such as Benchmark, Technical Experiment, sub-properties like Performance efficiency, Quality of Method, Accuracy, Product Quality ([8]), as well as evaluations using Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview ([11]) and another instance mentioning Verification together with Technical Experiment ([12]). 

• In the 2018 publications, there is evidence of evaluations that use Interview and Field Experiment ([3]), as well as Interview combined with Questionnaire for an industrial survey evaluation ([10]). In one instance the same publication details evaluations that applied Questionnaire and Case Study methods ([14]). 

• For 2019, the texts report that one publication conducted a Case Study evaluation ([1]), while another used Technical Experiment and Argumentation ([7]). Still other 2019 publications employed Focus Group and Questionnaire ([13]) and another applied Argumentation together with Motivating Example ([16]). 

In summary, among those publications that evaluate compatibility in the given period, the methods applied are distributed in 2017 as a mix including Technical Experiment, Controlled Experiment, Motivating Example, Argumentation, Verification, Benchmark (and related quality/property evaluations such as Performance efficiency, Quality of Method, Accuracy, Product Quality, Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Interview). In 2018, the evaluations include Interview, Field Experiment, Questionnaire, and Case Study. In 2019, the evaluation approaches applied include Case Study, Technical Experiment, Argumentation, Focus Group, Questionnaire, and Motivating Example. 

Each source provided ([1], [2], [3], [5], [7], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [16]) contributes to this overall picture of a diverse set of evaluation methods used to assess compatibility over the 2017–2019 period.

• Source [7] indicates that “Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared” (also published in 2018) employed a Controlled Experiment.

• Two sources ([1] and [5]) state that one paper published in 2019 explicitly investigated a research object that includes an entity called “Architecture Extraction.”

• In contrast, several other sources ([2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]) indicate that either no paper published in 2019 investigated “Architecture Extraction” or that the investigation pertained to a different research object (such as “Architecture Pattern,” “Architecture Analysis Method,” or “Architecture Decisions”) or was published in a different year.

Thus, the information is contradictory. Some texts assert that one 2019 paper addressed “Architecture Extraction” ([1] and [5]), whereas others do not. 

Final Answer: According to sources [1] and [5], one paper investigated the research object “Architecture Extraction” in 2019; however, many other sources do not support this.

For example, sources [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], and [28] all conclude that no paper satisfies both conditions. Although source [9] reports that one paper—""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" (publication year 2018)—meets the criteria, the overwhelming majority of the provided texts indicate that no papers qualify. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

No papers have a personal experience paper as their paper class while also applying the evaluation method Technical Experiment, and thus there is no ranking by publication year.

Two texts ([1] and [3]) mention papers investigating Architecture Evolution published in 2020, while two other texts ([2] and [4]) indicate that one paper investigating Architecture Evolution was published in 2021 and no paper is noted for 2020. The remaining texts ([5]–[8]) do not provide evidence of any papers on Architecture Evolution for either year (or attribute the mentioned papers to different research objects).

If we rely on the texts that explicitly link the research object “Architecture Evolution” with a publication year, then the more consistent answer (per [2] and [4]) is that one paper was published in 2021 and no paper is clearly identified for 2020.

Thus, the final answer is:
• In 2020: 0 papers  
• In 2021: 1 paper

In contrast, sources [2] and [4] state that one paper evaluating Maintainability was published in 2020 and none for 2017. Additionally, source [5] reports that a paper evaluating Maintainability was published in 2018, and source [6] indicates that no paper in 2017 or 2020 evaluates Maintainability.

Thus, depending on which partial answer is taken as correct, the evaluation of Maintainability is reported for either 2017 (with no corresponding paper in 2020) or for 2020 (with no corresponding paper in 2017), with one source suggesting the evaluation occurred in 2018 and another suggesting neither year includes an evaluation.

• Most of the texts conclude that—with one exception or two candidate cases—no paper satisfies all three required conditions simultaneously (i.e. published in 2017, investigating the research object “Architecture Design Method,” and having not used input data).  
• Two partial answers, however, report a 2017 publication that investigates Architecture Design Method while indicating that its associated evidence shows input data was not used. One description [8] identifies “An Architecture Framework for Modelling and Simulation of Situational-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems” as being published in 2017, with evidence (per descriptions in texts [7] and [10]) showing that although input data is mentioned, it is flagged as not available or not used. Another description [20] presents “Design Criteria to Architect Continuous Experimentation for Self-Driving Vehicles” as published in 2017. In [20] the contribution investigates the research object “Architecture Design Method” and – despite one note in [3] mentioning that input data is utilized – the more explicit indications from [6] and [8] claim that input data was not used.

In summary, while many texts rule out a compliant paper, the only instances that come close are these two papers. Their publication years (2017) and research focus (Architecture Design Method) are confirmed; however, the matter of input data is somewhat ambiguous. Still, the explicit indications in texts [8] and [20] lead to the following final conclusion:

Based on the provided texts, the only papers from 2017 that investigate the research object “Architecture Design Method” are (1) “An Architecture Framework for Modelling and Simulation of Situational-Aware Cyber-Physical Systems” [8] and (2) “Design Criteria to Architect Continuous Experimentation for Self-Driving Vehicles” [20]. In both cases the evidence is reported as showing that input data was not used (or was not available), thus meeting all the specified criteria.

• Several 2018 papers fall within Software Architecture and Design and are related to topics that can be interpreted as involving architecture decision making. However, only a few of them come with explicit supporting evidence that (a) they address decision‐making issues (for example, by involving an Architecture Description Language, classification of architectural knowledge, or explicit naming of “architecture decision making”) and (b) the evidence notes that their input data is not available (for example, marked “None” or “False”).

• One paper is “A DSL for MAPE Patterns Representation in Self-adapting Systems” [6]. According to multiple sources, this paper is placed in the Software Architecture and Design field (with contributions such as an Architecture Description Language) and several descriptions explicitly note that the evidence’s input data is not available.

• Another candidate is “Using Informal Knowledge for Improving Software Quality Trade-Off Decisions” [14]. This work is also contextualized within Software Architecture and Design—that is, it addresses issues related to decision making—and some sources state that its evidence does not include available input data.

• A further paper mentioned is “A Quantitative Approach for the Assessment of Microservice Architecture Deployment Alternatives by Automated Performance Testing” [19]. Its association with an Architecture Analysis Method implies that it deals with architecture decision making, and although one source notes that input data is “used,” at least two other sources (Texts 5 and 6) explicitly indicate that the input data is either not used or marked as not available.

It is important to note that for all these papers there is some conflicting evidence regarding input data. Also, if one interprets the requirement as excluding papers published in 2018 (so that only papers from other years would qualify), then none of the papers meet the criteria because all the mentioned works are from 2018. But if the intended focus is solely on the availability of input data as flagged in the evidence (with the publication year being a constant), then the above three papers are the ones that (at least in parts of the evidence) investigate architecture decision‐making topics and come with indications that their input data is not available.

Final Answer (with citations): 

Based solely on the provided texts, the following 2018 papers are described as investigating architecture decision making (or related architectural decision issues) and having evidence where the input data is flagged as not available (despite some conflicting statements):

 • “A DSL for MAPE Patterns Representation in Self-adapting Systems” [6]  
 • “Using Informal Knowledge for Improving Software Quality Trade-Off Decisions” [14]  
 • “A Quantitative Approach for the Assessment of Microservice Architecture Deployment Alternatives by Automated Performance Testing” [19]

Keep in mind that several of the sources mentioned conflicts with respect to input data availability, so the above list relies on those texts that explicitly note the absence of input data.

In text [3] the paper “On Cognitive Biases in Architecture Decision Making” is described as having been evaluated using a Focus Group and being associated with 2017, with explicit indications that input data was not used. Note that other texts either do not mention the Focus Group method for a paper in 2017 or present conflicting information regarding input data usage (as in text [4]), while several texts state that no paper meets the criteria (texts [1], [2], [5], [6], [7], [8], and [9]). 

Thus, based solely on the provided partial answers, “On Cognitive Biases in Architecture Decision Making” is the paper that has the Focus Group evaluation method, was published in 2017, and did not use input data [3].

Even though some texts note that the explicit connection between grounded theory and evaluation is not always mentioned, one instance clearly states that a 2019 publication applied grounded theory in its evaluation and is classified as a Paper Class [6]. Additionally, several other texts consistently report that relevant papers published in 2019 fall under this class. Thus, we conclude that the ""Paper Class"" is the most frequent classification for these evaluation studies in 2019.

Some sources indicate that the only paper investigating the object architecture description in the specified period was published in 2018—with no corresponding mention of any papers from 2019 or 2020 ([1], [3], [4], [5], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [24], [26], [30]). In contrast, other sources indicate that the only paper in this category was published in 2020—with again no paper mentioned in 2019 ([2], [6], [8], [11], [15], [16], [22], [23], [25], [27], [28], [29]).

Thus, according solely to the provided texts, one set of partial answers ranges the investigation to a single 2018 publication while another set ranges it to a single 2020 publication. In both cases, there is no mention of any paper from 2019.
