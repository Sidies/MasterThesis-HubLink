Although several papers are evaluated at Research Level 2, every mention clarifies that Research Level 2 is either defined or confirmed as primary research (or explicitly noted as not representing secondary research). Even in instances where there appear to be conflicting mentions (as in some entries where a “secondary research” flag is discussed), the overall conclusion remains that no paper is explicitly designated with research level secondary research.

One source [1] indicates that “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” is explicitly described as contributing to Paper Class 2, while it does not provide explicit information about the paper class for “Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures.” In contrast, another source [2] explicitly states that “Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures” is a contribution in Paper Class 2—described as evaluation research rather than an opinion paper, a solution proposal, or a philosophical paper—while it does not supply details about the paper class for “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots.” There is no relevant information in [3] regarding either paper except that it discusses a different paper belonging to Paper Class 2.

Thus, based on [1] and [2], both papers are described as falling under Paper Class 2, although each source only explicitly provides information for one paper. This suggests that, compared to “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” (which is identified as Paper Class 2 in [1]), the paper “Supporting Architectural Decision Making on Data Management in Microservice Architectures” is also considered to belong to Paper Class 2 as per [2].

In addition, one source indicates that a Controlled Experiment was also employed [1], while another source details an evaluation approach that incorporated a property (with a sub-property named Functional Suitability) [3]. 

Thus, the paper’s evaluation methods included: 
• A Technical Experiment (explicitly mentioned in both sources [1] and [3])  
• An evaluation based on a property approach featuring Functional Suitability [3]  
• A Controlled Experiment as noted in one source [1]

• Several texts associate António Silva with a 2020 paper that presents one research object (e.g. [1] and [5], with [19] also listing one research object). In contrast, other texts report a 2020 paper—but without explicitly linking it to António Silva—that presents two research objects ([4], [6], [9]).  
 
• For 2019, one partial answer states that António Silva’s 2019 paper contributed one research object ([2]). However, another text indicates that the 2019 work contributed two distinct research objects ([3] and [13]). Additionally, [14] describes a 2019 contribution of a research object that appears under two labels, but without explicit linking to António Silva.  
 
• In the case of 2021, several texts (such as [7], [11], [12], and [15]) show that a paper published in 2021 investigated two research objects, assuming António Silva is the author. Yet ([10]) reports a study from 2021 that contributed one research object.  
 
• Outside these years, one text ([16]) mentions a 2018 paper with one research object and another ([21]) reports a 2017 paper with one research object, again assuming António Silva’s authorship, while other 2017 papers presenting one or two research objects are also described ([8], [18], [20]).  
 
In summary, the texts do not present a single, consistent per‐year count clearly linked to António Silva. Instead, for the same publication years there are conflicting counts. For example:  
 
– 2017: Some texts report one research object ([21]);  
– 2018: One research object is reported ([16]);  
– 2019: One research object is mentioned in one account ([2]) while another account states two ([3], [13]);  
– 2020: There is a report of one research object ([1], [5], [19]) and other reports of two research objects ([4], [6], [9]);  
– 2021: Several texts report two research objects ([7], [11], [12], [15]) but one text reports a case with one research object ([10]).  
 
Thus, based solely on the provided texts, it is not possible to definitively state how many research objects António Silva investigated per publication year because (a) different texts provide conflicting numbers for the same year, and (b) in several cases the explicit linkage of the research objects to António Silva is not consistently stated.

• In 2017, multiple papers investigated research objects. For example, one paper examined both “First Research Object 2” and “Second Research Object 2” [2] while other papers—such as those discussed in [15], [17], [22], [23], [26], [28], and [29]—reported investigations of at least one research object (typically “First Research Object 2”). 

• In 2018, there are papers that contributed research objects. One work investigated two research objects [4], another paper focused on an investigation of “First Research Object 2” [13], and yet another study also contributed a research object in that year [24].

• In 2019, several papers are reported. Some works investigated two research objects (commonly “First Research Object 2” and “Second Research Object 2”) as mentioned in sources [5], [9], and [14]. Additionally, one paper related to architectural methods and design (with associated research object details) is noted for this year [12] and another investigation is described in [25].

• In 2020, multiple publications contributed research objects. One paper described an architectural approach to performance issues [1] while others reported on investigations including at least one research object [7], [8], [10], [16], and [21]. Another work in 2020 focused on “First Research Object 2” [30].

• In 2021, a series of papers have been reported to investigate the research objects (most often “First Research Object 2” and “Second Research Object 2”). Sources [3], [6], [11], [18], [19], [20], and [27] each refer to investigations conducted in that year.

Thus, based solely on the available information, the investigated research objects by the set of papers are distributed across the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, with several papers in each year focusing on either one or multiple research objects as detailed above.

• 2017: One paper (as detailed in [13]) was evaluated using one method.  
• 2018: Two papers (one in [2] and one in [8]) were each evaluated using one method, summing to two evaluation methods.  
• 2019: Two papers (one in [5] and one in [14]) were each evaluated using one method, summing to two evaluation methods.  
• 2020: Two papers (one in [1] and one in [4]) were each evaluated using one method, summing to two evaluation methods.  
• 2021: One paper (as detailed in [3]) was evaluated using one method.

It should be noted that several texts mention papers with an evaluation method but do not explicitly confirm Mauro Caporuscio’s authorship. In this final answer, only those items assumed to be his (as directed by the question context) were considered.

In several cases more than one paper is reported for a given year. (Note that the texts are not fully consistent with one another; the summaries below simply report the numbers as provided by the different sources.)

• 2017  
 – One source ([6]) reports that the paper “Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud‐Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks” used three evaluation approaches.  
 – Another source ([18]) reports that the paper “Experiments in Curation” was evaluated with two approaches.  

• 2018  
 – One paper (“Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures”) is reported in [1] as having two evaluation approaches.  
 – A different 2018 paper (“Applying Architecture‐Based Adaptation to Automate the Management of Internet‐of‐Things”) is reported in [2] as having one evaluation approach.  
 – Additional texts ([14], [15], [16] and [19]) also report 2018 papers in which two evaluation approaches were applied.  

• 2019  
 – One source ([3]) states that the 2019 paper (“Continuous Adaptation Management in Collective Intelligence Systems”) applied one (case study) evaluation approach.  

• 2020  
 – Several texts ([4], [5], [11], [12] and [17]) indicate that certain 2020 papers were evaluated by applying two distinct evaluation approaches (for example, “Technical Experiment” together with “Controlled Experiment,” “Argumentation,” or “Case Study”).  
 – Other texts ([10], [21] and [22]) report a 2020 paper in which a single evaluation approach (for example, “Technical Experiment,” “Focus Group” or “Case Study”) was explicitly applied.  

• 2021  
 – One account ([7] and [20]) indicates that a 2021 paper (“ArCode: Facilitating the Use of Application Frameworks to Implement Tactics and Patterns” or “Semi-automatic Feedback for Improving Architecture Conformance to Microservice Patterns and Practices”) applied one evaluation approach (“Technical Experiment”).  
 – Another account ([9] and [13]) reports a 2021 paper with two evaluation approaches (for example, one using “Motivating Example” and another using either “Focus Group” or “Interview”).  

In summary, depending on the paper and source, for each year the provided texts report:

 • 2017: either 3 or 2 evaluation approaches (from different papers).  
 • 2018: either 2 or 1 evaluation approach per paper (with several papers reported).  
 • 2019: 1 evaluation approach.  
 • 2020: either 2 or 1 evaluation approach per paper (with several papers reported).  
 • 2021: either 1 or 2 evaluation approaches (from different papers).

1. According to [1], the paper ""An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots"" applies the Field Experiment evaluation method and was published in 2018.

2. According to [3], the paper ""Decision Models for Microservices: Design Areas, Stakeholders, Use Cases, and Requirements"" applies the Field Experiment evaluation method and was published in 2017.

3. Additionally, [4] tells us that ""First Research Object 2"" applies the Field Experiment evaluation method. However, its publication year is not provided, so it cannot be ranked with respect to the other papers.

Thus, ranking the papers in descending order of publication year for those with known years, we have:
• ""An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots"" (2018)  
• ""Decision Models for Microservices: Design Areas, Stakeholders, Use Cases, and Requirements"" (2017)

The paper ""First Research Object 2"" applies the Field Experiment method as well, but its publication year is unknown, and hence it cannot be placed in the ranking.

However, the descriptions about its use of input data are conflicting. In several instances (see [2], [4], [6], [7], [8]) the contribution is indicated as having input data that was not made available (or “not used”), while in other instances (see [2], [4], [7], [8], [9]) the evidence suggests that input data was made available (or “used”). In aggregated counts, some texts note two instances where input data was not available compared to one instance where it was made available (see [4], [6], [9]). Therefore, although only one paper is involved, the available explicit details point to two instances showing that input data was not used versus one instance with available input data, leaving the issue unresolved due to contradictory information.

However, the records provide conflicting details about the availability of its input data. For example, some explicit statements indicate that the input data is publicly available (as noted in one instance in [1], [3], and [6]), whereas other explicit statements indicate that it is not publicly available (with this view expressed twice in [1] and by [2], [3], [4], [7], and [8]). 

In summary, while there is only one publication using Grounded Theory for evaluation, one source reports its input data as publicly available and two sources report that it is not publicly available.

Several sources (for example [1], [3], [4], [5], [8], and [12]) report that one paper was evaluated on Usability and no paper was evaluated on Portability. In contrast, other sources ([2], [6], and [11]) indicate that a single paper (or one evaluation instance) was associated with Portability while no evaluation of Usability was reported. One source ([7]) mentions that one paper reported an evaluation of Portability (one instance) alongside two evaluations of Usability, and yet another ([13]) claims that evaluations of Portability occurred twice and that Usability was not evaluated at all. In addition, one source ([9]) and another ([10]) assert that neither property was evaluated.

Thus, depending on which texts are emphasized, one might answer either that the most common finding is that one paper evaluated Usability while none evaluated Portability, or that the reverse or even a mixed evaluation occurred. 

Without external clarification, the most frequently repeated conclusion across the texts is that among papers investigating Architecture Design Method, there is one instance where the property Usability was evaluated and no instance where Portability was evaluated [1][3][4][5][8][12].

• The paper described in [4] (toward a reference architecture for cloud‐based plant genotyping and phenotyping analysis frameworks) is evaluated in two different contributions—one instance focusing on usability in one contribution and another instance that covers usability plus an evaluation of portability in the other. This yields two usability instances and one portability instance.

• The paper in [8] (on reducing development overheads with a model‐centric architecture for online games) includes separate evaluations that explicitly cover usability and portability—one instance each.

• The investigation in [9] (applying architecture‐based adaptation to manage IoT) considers one evaluation property focused on portability and none for usability.

• Finally, [13] describes an evaluation of “Constructing a Shared Infrastructure for Software Architecture Analysis and Maintenance” where a property is identified as usability (with no indication of any portability focus).

Summing the contributions from these reference architecture investigations:
• Usability is explicitly focused on in the instances from [3] (1), the two usability instances from [4] (2), [8] (1), and [13] (1), for a total of 5 instances.
• Portability is explicitly evaluated in the instance from [1] (1), from [4] (1), from [8] (1), and from [9] (1), for a total of 4 instances.

Thus, among the papers investigating a reference architecture, there are 5 instances with a focus on usability compared to 4 instances with a focus on portability.

Overall, nearly every paper linked to architecture evolution is reported with conflicting descriptions regarding the use of input data. In several instances different sources within the texts indicate that for a given paper the contribution (usually labeled “Evidence 2”) both does and does not use input data. That said, the following points summarize the explicit “not used” reports:

• In one account, the paper “Using Informal Knowledge for Improving Software Quality Trade-Off Decisions” is associated with architecture evolution and, although input data is mentioned elsewhere, one source (Text [2]) explicitly clarifies that its input data was incorporated but not actually used.

• In the case of “EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring,” at least two accounts (Texts [2] and [3]) indicate that its input data is either not used or not available—even though one account (Text [1]) claims that input data is used.

• “Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context” is another example where one or two descriptions (Texts [5] description (2) and (3)) report that input data is not used, even though another description indicates it is used.

• “Architecture‐Based Change Impact Analysis in Information Systems and Business Processes” (Text [15]) is also reported with conflicting information: Two sources indicate that input data was not used while one source marks it as used.

• Similarly, “Aligning Architecture with Business Goals in the Automotive Domain” (Text [16]) is explicitly noted in one description (Text [2]) as having its Evidence 2 use input data that is marked as not used, even though other texts report the opposite.

• Finally, in “Constructing a Shared Infrastructure for Software Architecture Analysis and Maintenance” (Text [18]) one description explicitly shows that its Evidence 2 has “None” as the input data (with a False flag), meaning no input data is used, though other descriptions conflict with this.

An additional work (“Exploiting Architecture/Runtime Model-Driven Traceability for Performance Improvement,” Text [19]) is reported with conflicting details, with one account explicitly stating that input data is not used.

In summary, no paper investigating architecture evolution is consistently presented as not using input data. However, if one chooses to list instances where the evidence specifically indicates that input data is not used, then the following cases may be noted:

 – “Using Informal Knowledge for Improving Software Quality Trade-Off Decisions” [2]  
 – “EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi-objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring” (in some descriptions) [4]  
 – “Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context” (in some descriptions) [5]  
 – “Architecture‐Based Change Impact Analysis in Information Systems and Business Processes” (in some descriptions) [15]  
 – “Aligning Architecture with Business Goals in the Automotive Domain” (in one description) [16]  
 – “Constructing a Shared Infrastructure for Software Architecture Analysis and Maintenance” (in one description) [18]  
 – “Exploiting Architecture/Runtime Model-Driven Traceability for Performance Improvement” (in one description) [19]

Thus, while many texts indicate that input data is used, several of the papers have at least one instance or description stating that the input data was not used. Because the evidence is conflicting, one cannot definitively nominate any single paper as clearly not using input data across all accounts.

• According to [1], the paper “Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study” used the Questionnaire method and provided Evidence 2 showing that no input data was used.  
• [2] reports that “Continuous Analysis of Collaborative Design” was evaluated using Questionnaire and that its contributed Evidence 2 explicitly characterizes the input data as not being used.  
• In [3], the contribution from the study titled “An Exploratory Study of Naturalistic Decision Making in Complex Software Architecture Environments” (providing First Research Object 2 evaluated by Questionnaire) includes an Evidence 2 indicating that no input data was used (despite one conflicting statement, the explicit wording on the input data not being used is taken as valid).  
• [4] identifies “Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis” as a paper that used Questionnaire, and later texts in the source indicate that the associated Evidence 2 shows the input data was not available/used.  
• [5] explains that “Identifying and Prioritizing Architectural Debt Through Architectural Smells: A Case Study in a Large Software Company” featured a contribution (First Research Object 2) evaluated with the Questionnaire method, while its corresponding Evidence 2 specifies (by indicating details such as None and False) that no input data was used.  
• Finally, [6] describes “Improving the Consistency and Usefulness of Architecture Descriptions: Guidelines for Architects” as having an evaluation using the Questionnaire method with Evidence 2 that clearly shows no input data was used.

Thus, these six papers are the ones that use the evaluation method Questionnaire while indicating that no input data was used [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6].

• According to [1], “Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared” employs a controlled experiment and explicitly notes that its input data is not available.  
• As stated in [2], “On the Understandability of Semantic Constraints for Behavioral Software Architecture Compliance: A Controlled Experiment” applies a controlled experiment and uses input data that is marked as not available.  
• [3] shows that “REST vs GraphQL: A Controlled Experiment” applies a controlled experiment; despite one excerpt mentioning that input data is “used,” the explicit property marking input data as not available confirms this paper does not have available input data.  
• In [4], “Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games” is clearly evaluated by a controlled experiment and the associated evidence explicitly notes that input data is not available.  
• [5] indicates that “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions” is evaluated via a controlled experiment and no input data is provided.  
• [8] reports that “Modeling of Parametric Dependencies for Performance Prediction of Component‑Based Software Systems at Run‑Time” is evaluated using a controlled experiment and (per text [4]) its input data is not available.  
• [10] states that “A Goal-Driven Approach for Deploying Self-Adaptive IoT Systems,” which is evaluated through a method interpreted as a controlled experiment, does not have any input data available.  
• [11] shows that “A Flexible Architecture for Key Performance Indicators Assessment in Smart Cities” employs an experiment-based (controlled) evaluation and its evidence notes that no input data is available.  
• [12] details that “Synthesis and Quantitative Verification of Tradeoff Spaces for Families of Software Systems” uses a controlled (Technical) Experiment and (based on texts [2] and [4]) the input data is not available.  
• As reported in [13], “ECo-IoT: An Architectural Approach for Realizing Emergent Configurations in the Internet of Things” is evaluated via a controlled experiment and its evidence confirms that input data is not available.  
• [15] indicates that “Empowering SysML‐Based Software Architecture Description with Formal Verification: From SysADL to CSP” applies a controlled experiment (via a Technical Experiment) and explicitly states the input data is not available.  
• [16] shows that “Quantitative Verification-Aided Machine Learning: A Tandem Approach for Architecting Self-Adaptive IoT Systems” uses a controlled experiment (via a Technical Experiment) and explicitly notes that, for the relevant evidence, the input data is not available.  
• [17] reports that “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” is evaluated via a controlled (technical) experiment and its Evidence 2 explicitly indicates that input data is not available.  
• [19] presents “EASIER: An Evolutionary Approach for Multi‐objective Software ArchItecturE Refactoring” as applying a controlled experiment with evidence showing that input data is not available.  
• [20] states that “Providing Context as a Service Using Service-Oriented Mobile Indie Fog and Opportunistic Computing” is evaluated by a controlled experiment (Technical Experiment) and that its input data is explicitly noted as not available.  
• [21] explains that “Architectural Patterns for Cross‑Domain Personalised Automotive Functions” employs a controlled (technical) experiment with evidence explicitly marking input data as not available.  
• Finally, [23] clarifies that within “Data‑Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures” the contribution designated as First Research Object 2 is evaluated using a controlled experiment and there is no mention of associated input data.

Each of these papers (or contributions within the papers) meets the criteria of using a controlled experiment while not having any input data available, as explicitly supported by the cited texts.

Every instance in which a paper applies the evaluation method Case Study and is associated with an architecture-related research object consistently shows that the paper appears under Paper Class 2. While there is some variation in how the research object is labeled (for example, as Architecture Analysis Method, Architectural Aspects, or similar terms), the paper class designation remains Paper Class 2 throughout.

Therefore, the final answer is: Paper Class 2.

According to [1], this research object is also known as Reference Architecture, and [2] supports that First Research Object 2 is the object evaluated using Field Experiment. Likewise, [3] indicates that First Research Object 2—also described as Architecture Optimization Method—is the subject of a Field Experiment evaluation. It should be noted that [4] presents a divergence by indicating that although the research object (referred to as Architecture Design Method) is First Research Object 2, there is no explicit mention of Field Experiment being applied. However, considering the majority of the sources, the research object investigated in the papers using the Field Experiment evaluation method is First Research Object 2 [1][2][3].

In these cases the evaluation of First Research Object 2 includes a property labeled “Reliability.” In contrast, several other papers investigate research objects—namely First Research Object 2 and Second Research Object 2—in evaluations that involve various properties (e.g., Effectiveness, Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, etc.), but none of these texts explicitly indicate that those evaluations were concerned with reliability ([1], [7], [8], [10], [12], [16]). 

Thus, while multiple papers are evaluating research objects, only those that assess First Research Object 2 explicitly mention “Reliability” as an evaluation property.

For example, several papers make use of a method called Technical Experiment ([1], [4], [9], [20], [26], [28]), while others report using Interview ([2], [12]) and Field Experiment ([2]). In addition, some studies use Argumentation as an evaluation method ([3], [11], [18]), and Motivating Example is also mentioned ([3], [7], [23]). Other explicitly stated methods include Controlled Experiment ([4], [6], [20]), Focus Group ([5], [12], [24]), and Questionnaire ([5], [6], [15], [19], [24]).  
 
There are also instances where methods labeled as Verification ([10]) and Case Study ([13], [14], [16], [17], [19], [25], [27], [30]) are applied. One paper even mentions a Data Science approach in the context of its evaluation ([29]). In one case there is a note that for a particular research object, the evaluation method was recorded as “False” ([22], [26]), which may indicate that no valid evaluation method was applied or that it was designated as such in the data.  

Thus, the evaluation methods extracted from the provided texts include:  
• Technical Experiment  
• Controlled Experiment  
• Interview and Field Experiment  
• Argumentation  
• Motivating Example  
• Focus Group  
• Questionnaire  
• Verification  
• Case Study  
• Data Science  

Each of these methods is applied within the broader evaluation process – often indicated through the use of an Evaluation Method List – to assess contributions related to compatibility in the respective papers ([1]–[30]).

For example, one source [1] (and similarly [6], [13], [16], [17], [25], [26], [27], [28], [30]) explicitly cites only one evaluation method (with names such as “Case Study,” “Technical Experiment,” or “Grounded Theory” in different contexts). In contrast, several other sources indicate that two distinct evaluation methods are applied. For instance, [2], [4], [7], [9], [12], [14], [18], [20], [22], [23], [24], and [29] mention pairs of methods such as “Verification” and “Technical Experiment,” “Argumentation” and “Controlled Experiment,” or “Questionnaire” and “Case Study.” Meanwhile, a few sources [3], [10], and [11] claim that three evaluation methods are applied, naming methods like “Focus Group,” “Questionnaire,” “Interview,” “Argumentation,” “Technical Experiment,” or “Motivating Example.”

Thus, depending on which interpretation or set of texts one considers, the number of evaluation methods applied to evaluate reliability is reported as either one, two, or three different methods [1], [2], [3], [4], [6] … [30].

Several papers (for instance, those described in [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [8], and [9]) report evaluating two research objects (commonly referred to as First Research Object 2 and Second Research Object 2). However, other papers (such as those indicated in [7], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], and [20]) report evaluating only one research object, typically labeled as First Research Object 2. 

Thus, among the papers that evaluate compatibility—or more generally include an evaluation process—the number of research objects evaluated is not uniform across all papers. Some studies evaluate two research objects, while others evaluate one. Each source should be consulted for the specific study in question.

  1. Second Research Object 2  
  2. First Research Object 2  
  
(See [1], [2], [4], [6], [14], [15], [16], [22], [25], and [28].)

It should be noted that some texts mention only one evaluation target (namely “First Research Object 2”) or include an additional labeling of that same object with names such as “Architecture Design Method,” “Reference Architecture,” “Architectural Assumptions,” “Architecture Extraction,” “Architecture Pattern,” “Architecture Description Language,” or “Architecture Analysis Method” ([3], [5], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [17], [20], [21], [23], [24], [26], [27], [29]). However, the predominant—and most consistently reported—set of evaluated research objects across the publications are “First Research Object 2” and “Second Research Object 2.” 

Thus, among those publications that include an evaluation (in relation to compatibility), the evaluation is applied on “Second Research Object 2” and “First Research Object 2,” with the descending alphabetical order given above.

• In some instances the texts indicate that both Satisfaction and Context Coverage are evaluated once in the same evaluation instance (for example, see [2], [3], [5], and [7]). In these cases the evaluation of the research object (albeit sometimes linked with objects such as “Architecture Decision Making” rather than “Architecture Evolution”) shows each property appearing exactly one time.

• In contrast, many other texts (for example, [1], [4], [9]–[12], [13]–[14], [16]–[22]) report an evaluation in which the property Satisfaction is explicitly mentioned while there is no mention at all of a property called Context Coverage. In those cases, only Satisfaction is evaluated.

Therefore, while there is evidence that in one paper both properties were each evaluated once, overall the texts do not consistently report an evaluation of Context Coverage in papers investigating Architecture Evolution. This leaves us with an ambiguous picture: in some contributions the two properties appear with the same frequency (one each), but in many cases only Satisfaction is evaluated and Context Coverage is not mentioned.

In several contributions—from the ones where both evaluation properties are explicitly mentioned—it is observed that when both satisfaction and context coverage are evaluated, they are typically measured once each [1], [2], [3], [5], [7], [9], [10]. However, there is an exception where satisfaction is evaluated twice while context coverage is evaluated once [4].

In contrast, several publications only report the evaluation of satisfaction without any mention of context coverage [6], [11], [12], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Additionally, a few publications explicitly include an evaluation of context coverage but do not report a corresponding evaluation of satisfaction [13], [14]. Finally, in some cases, satisfaction is the only property discussed, making any direct comparison with context coverage impossible [15].

Thus, among the publications that do evaluate both properties, satisfaction and context coverage are generally being evaluated with equal frequency (i.e., one instance each), except in the one instance where satisfaction is evaluated twice compared to one evaluation of context coverage. Overall, many studies report only on the evaluation of satisfaction with no corresponding data on context coverage.

Several texts indicate that Maintainability is indeed examined (with at least one instance tied to a case study evaluation). In contrast, none of the texts consistently indicate that the property Usability is evaluated using the Case Study method. For example, while one text [2] mentions that a sub-property named Usability is examined, no texts clearly state that this evaluation is performed through a Case Study. Other sources [3], [5], and [6] either provide conflicting counts or do not mention a Case Study evaluation for Usability at all. 

Thus, the available evidence supports that Maintainability is evaluated (using the Case Study method), whereas there is no conclusive information that Usability is evaluated by this method.

Thus, among publications that apply a controlled experiment in their evaluation, one finds divergent practices. Some studies report evaluating usability but not maintainability, others report evaluating maintainability but not usability, and in a few cases both are evaluated equally.

Several studies that investigate Technical Debt (or a related research object) without following an evaluation guideline (i.e. when “Has Guideline” is False) report a range of evaluation properties. For example, one description of a paper on Technical Debt [1] shows that the evaluation explicitly examined Maintainability and Product Quality. Other texts report different sets of properties. In one case the evaluation was said to include Accuracy and Quality of Method [2], while another description [3] lists Performance efficiency, Functional Suitability, and Product Quality. Further, additional texts describe evaluations that examined properties such as Functional Suitability combined with Product Quality [4], [5], [12], and [13], and yet another report mentions that Portability and Security were also evaluated [6]. 

Some studies broaden the focus even further. For instance, one evaluation with guideline set to False explicitly considered Efficiency (or a related sub‐property such as Performance efficiency) along with Product Quality [7] while another instance reports Effectiveness and Quality in Use [11] or even a combination of Functional Suitability, Efficiency, Quality in Use, and Performance efficiency [17]. Other texts add even more detail by reporting sub‐properties such as Context coverage and Satisfaction alongside Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, and Product Quality [18], [19], [20]. In one evaluation where additional properties were considered, the explicitly mentioned properties were Effectiveness, Quality in Use, and Satisfaction in addition to Product Quality [15], [20]. Additionally, one report on a Technical Debt study specifically notes Maintainability and Product Quality [1] while another mentions Accuracy and Quality of Method [2]. 

In summary, across the provided texts the evaluations performed without an accompanying guideline have explicitly examined properties including, but not limited to:  

• Functional Suitability  
• Product Quality  
• Accuracy  
• Quality of Method  
• Maintainability  
• Performance efficiency (or Efficiency)  
• Portability  
• Security  
• Effectiveness  
• Quality in Use  
• Satisfaction  
• (Additionally, some evaluations mention sub‐properties such as Context coverage)

This range of evaluation properties shows that while there is no unique set of criteria applied to papers investigating Technical Debt without a guideline, many of them explicitly report on aspects such as Functional Suitability and Product Quality (see, for example, [1], [4], [5], [12], and [13]), with others also examining accuracy, method quality, performance, and user‐centric qualities like effectiveness and satisfaction ([2], [7], [11], [15], [17], [18], [19], [20]).

The answer is organized by citing the respective sources where these details were described:

• One publication is reported to have evaluated Performance efficiency and Product Quality without a guideline [1].  
• In another work, several properties were evaluated guideline‐free including Product Quality, Quality of Method, Quality in Use, Accuracy, Efficiency, and Performance efficiency [3].  
• An evaluation that did not follow a guideline was also described for Quality in Use, Product Quality, Satisfaction, Efficiency, Performance efficiency, and Context coverage [4].  
• In a separate investigation, the properties evaluated without following a guideline were Quality in Use, Satisfaction, Effectiveness, and Freedom from Risk [5].  
• Another study reported that the evaluation of a contribution was carried out without a guideline for Quality of Method, Product Quality, Functional Suitability, and Accuracy [6].  
• For Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems, evaluations without a guideline covered at least Product Quality and Functional Suitability [7].  
• One instance of a First Research Object 2 evaluated without a guideline was associated with Quality in Use, Satisfaction, Efficiency and Context coverage [8].  
• In another work, an evaluation without guideline examined Quality of Method, Quality in Use, Product Quality, Accuracy, Functional Suitability, and Effectiveness [10] (and [12] reiterates a similar list including Performance efficiency).  
• Some studies specify evaluations of contributions in which no specific property names were linked to the guideline‐free evaluation (e.g. [9] and [16]) although several properties are generally assessed in those publications.  
• Yet another publication explored evaluations without a guideline for Quality of Method and Accuracy [17] and another for Quality in Use, Product Quality, Effectiveness, Functional Suitability, and Performance efficiency [18].  
• One article presented two evaluation instances—one without a guideline—although it does not explicitly assign any property names to the non‐guideline evaluation [19].  
• In a further work, properties such as Quality in Use, Product Quality, Satisfaction, Context coverage, and Performance efficiency were evaluated without a guideline [20].  
• In one study in the field of Microservice Resiliency Patterns, Product Quality, Performance efficiency, and Functional Suitability were evaluated in a guideline‐free evaluation [21].  
• In the study “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions,” the evaluation without a guideline covered Product Quality, Usability, Performance efficiency, and Functional Suitability [23].  
• For “Architectural Patterns for Cross‑Domain Personalised Automotive Functions,” the evaluation without a guideline covered Product Quality, Quality of Method, Functional Suitability, and Accuracy [24].  
• In the “Experiments in Curation: Towards Machine-Assisted Construction of Software Architecture Knowledge Bases” study, properties such as Quality of Method, Product Quality, Accuracy, Performance efficiency (and a validity aspect) were evaluated without following a guideline [25].  
• Another publication reported evaluations without a guideline for Product Quality and Security [26].  
• One contribution noted that “Quality in Use” (along with its sub‑property Effectiveness) was evaluated without following a guideline [27].  
• Some texts indicate that Quality of Method and Accuracy were evaluated in an evaluation explicitly lacking a guideline [28].  
• In contrast, one study explicitly states that all its evaluated properties (Quality in Use, Product Quality, Efficiency, Satisfaction, and Usability) were assessed while following a guideline, so none are listed as guideline‐free [29].  
• Finally, another publication reported that an evaluation without a guideline (again for its First Research Object 2 and Second Research Object 2) involved the properties Quality in Use, Effectiveness, Usability, and Product Quality [30].

Thus, among publications investigating architectural assumptions, a wide range of properties have been evaluated without following a guideline. These include, in various combinations across the studies, Performance efficiency, Product Quality, Quality of Method, Quality in Use, Accuracy, Efficiency, Functional Suitability, Satisfaction, Effectiveness, Context coverage, Freedom from Risk, Reliability, Security, Maintainability, Usability, and even references to a Threats to Validity Guideline.

Specifically, these sources mention that for ""First Research Object 2"" the evaluation employs the Field Experiment method and that its guideline setting is marked as False. However, note that there is conflicting information: one source ([2]) explicitly states that while ""First Research Object 2"" is evaluated with Field Experiment, it is done with a guideline (i.e. marked as True), and another source ([3]) does not mention Field Experiment at all. 

Given these differences, the answer that aligns with the field experiment method and the absence of an evaluation guideline is: 

""First Research Object 2"" was evaluated without an evaluation guideline using the Field Experiment method ([1], [4]).

For example, source [1] states that First Research Object 2 is evaluated without a guideline; sources [2] and [3] reinforce that the evaluation of First Research Object 2 is performed without a guideline (even when represented under different labels, such as Architecture Pattern); and similar confirmations appear in sources [4], [5], [7], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [17], [20], [21], [22], [23], and [24]. 

Thus, among publications that (or whose evaluations are associated with) grounded theory–inspired evaluation methods, the research object that is evaluated without using a guideline is First Research Object 2 [1][2][3][4][5][7][10][11][12][13][14][17][20][21][22][23][24].

Several sources explicitly state that evaluations—including those from First Research Object 2, Second Research Object 2, and other contributions—rely on these two properties when assessing the research object (see [7], [9], [16], [22]). 

Other properties such as Maintainability, Performance efficiency, Quality in Use, Accuracy, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Freedom from Risk, Portability, and Security are mentioned in some texts. However, Functional Suitability and Product Quality appear most frequently and are thus identified as the properties most often investigated for the research objects in the study. 

Note that while the question refers to Technical Debt, the texts do not explicitly label any research object as Technical Debt; they indicate evaluation properties for various contributions in the domain.

Several publications consistently indicate that certain quality properties are examined more frequently than others. For example, multiple sources point to Product Quality as being evaluated in more than one instance ([1], [2], [3], [6], [12], [15], [27]). In addition, Quality in Use is often mentioned as one of the repeatedly assessed properties ([1], [7], [9], [25], [30]). Other properties—such as Functional Suitability and Performance efficiency—are also reported as being evaluated more than once in some studies ([2], [3], [6], [21]). 

Thus, among publications investigating architectural assumptions, the properties that have been evaluated most often include Product Quality and Quality in Use, with additional frequent attention given to Functional Suitability and Performance efficiency ([1], [2], [3], [6], [7], [9], [12], [15], [21], [27]).

For example, one study explicitly examining Architecture Evolution used both “Technical Experiment” and “Questionnaire” (see [4]), which means each method appears only once in that context. Additionally, another paper investigating Architecture Evolution applied the “Technical Experiment” method (see [1]), while several other papers from 2021 mention evaluation methods (such as “Case Study,” “Motivating Example,” “Data Science,” “Focus Group,” “Interview”) but none of these are explicitly linked to a research object named Architecture Evolution. In summary, because the available texts do not provide repeated evidence pointing to one particular evaluation method for Architecture Evolution, there is no single evaluation method that has been applied more than the others in 2021 [1][4][7].

• In 2017 one study applied Benchmark once [3].  
• In 2018 there was no instance of Benchmark (only “Case Study” was mentioned) [10].  
• In 2019 two studies are reported. One study indicates Benchmark was used once [1] while another explicitly shows that an evaluation method was set to False (i.e., not Benchmark) [4].  
• In 2020 two separate studies applied Benchmark once each—one study applied it once [2] and another did so once [8]. (Other texts for 2020 describe evaluation methods different from Benchmark.)  
• In 2021 none of the studies applied Benchmark (evaluations were either explicitly marked as False or used other methods) [5, 9].  

Thus, based on the provided texts, Benchmark was applied as follows per publication year:  
– 2017: 1 instance  
– 2018: 0 instances  
– 2019: 1 instance from one study (with another study showing 0)  
– 2020: 2 instances  
– 2021: 0 instances

In several sources the evaluation is explicitly described as involving a property known as Functional Suitability (often noted to include an additional sub‐property) [1,3,4,10,11,12,15,16,20]. In other descriptions, Product Quality is also mentioned as an evaluated property [2,3,4,7,10,11,13,15,20]. Moreover, additional texts describe evaluations employing other properties, such as Effectiveness [5,8,14,17], Performance efficiency [9,18,19,20], Accuracy and Quality of Method [6,19], and further properties like Quality in Use, Robustness, Usability, and Satisfaction [7,14,18,19,20]. One source [21] even notes that the evaluation method itself was set to False rather than positively asserting an evaluation property.

Thus, while the evidence points to a multifaceted evaluation approach—most prominently featuring Functional Suitability and Product Quality—the texts do not clarify which one property specifically applies to the paper titled “Enabling Continuous Software Engineering for Embedded Systems Architectures with Virtual Prototypes.”

Source [1] states that FLRA was evaluated through a process that measured properties like Functional Suitability and Product Quality but noted that no specific guidelines were followed. Other sources describe evaluation methods (such as Technical Experiment in [2] and [7], Case Study in [3] and [6], and Focus Group in [5]) for different contributions, but none of these sources explicitly state that the FLRA reference architecture was evaluated using any of these methods. 

Thus, based solely on the provided information, the FLRA paper appears to have been evaluated using an evaluation process that assessed its properties, but no explicit evaluation method (like Case Study, Technical Experiment, or Focus Group) is directly linked to it in the texts [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], and [7].

In many instances, the research objects were assessed for accuracy by applying evaluation methods drawn from a predefined list. For example, several texts explicitly report that an evaluation method named “Technical Experiment” was used in conjunction with an evaluation property called Accuracy [1], [2], [3], [15], [27], [23], [24]. In other cases, a “Case Study” was applied, and again Accuracy was one of the properties measured during that evaluation [4], [6], [7], [10], [12], [13], [17], [22].  

Additional evaluation methods that were reported alongside an Accuracy property include:  
• Benchmark – where the evaluation method entity “Benchmark” was used [5], [25], [26].  
• Data Science – where an evaluation method from the Evaluation Method List explicitly named “Data Science” was applied, with Accuracy as one of the evaluated properties [8], [21].  
• Controlled Experiment – where one evaluation employed a “Controlled Experiment” method [9].  
• Grounded Theory – where the evaluation process involved an evaluation method explicitly named “Grounded Theory” [18].  
• Focus Group – where the evaluation method was explicitly identified as “Focus Group,” again with Accuracy being one of the evaluation criteria [20].

In summary, the investigated objects in the papers were evaluated for accuracy by measuring the Accuracy property within evaluations that used methods such as Technical Experiment, Case Study, Benchmark, Data Science, Controlled Experiment, Grounded Theory, and Focus Group [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13], [15], [17], [18], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].

On the one hand, several studies applied assessments of properties closely tied to usability such as “Quality in Use,” “Functional Suitability,” “Effectiveness,” “Performance Efficiency,” “Satisfaction,” “Product Quality,” and “Quality of Method” [2, 8, 11, 15, 18, 20, 23, 26]. On the other hand, the evaluation methods explicitly mentioned across the papers include:

• Interview [1]  
• Controlled Experiment [2, 5, 24]  
• Technical Experiment [3, 4, 6, 10, 19, 27, 30]  
• Case Study [7, 9, 16, 21, 22, 23, 26]  
• Questionnaire [11, 17, 25]  
• Argumentation [8, 28]  
• Benchmark [20]  
• Focus Group [29]

Thus, in Lu Xiao’s publications the usability of objects is evaluated using both property‐based assessments (such as measuring “Quality in Use”) and a range of explicit evaluation methods—including Interview, Controlled Experiment, Technical Experiment, Case Study, Questionnaire, Argumentation, Benchmark, and Focus Group—to provide a comprehensive understanding of usability aspects [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].

• An evaluation method named “Case Study” was mentioned in several texts ([1], [4], [9], [12], [15], [19], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [28], [30]).  
• An evaluation method identified as “Motivating Example” was also explicitly mentioned in other texts ([2], [5], [11], [17]).  
• A further evaluation method explicitly noted is “Technical Experiment” ([3], [6], [7], [8], [10], [13], [16], [21], [27], [29]).  

Thus, according to the provided information, Stephan Seifermann applied evaluations using the methods “Case Study,” “Motivating Example,” and “Technical Experiment” in the context of the Architecture Analysis Method.

For example, one text [1] explains that the paper featuring David Monschein applied the Case Study method, while another text [4] shows that a paper by him used the Technical Experiment method. In both cases, only one evaluation method is applied in the respective paper. Thus, although different papers report different methods, in each paper the author applied just one evaluation method for evaluating Efficiency [1][4].

Some sources indicate that only one evaluation method was applied (for example, Text [1] and [3] mention a single method—“Case Study” or “Questionnaire,” while [7], [9], [10], [11], [13], [14], [17], [18], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], and [29] each name one distinct method such as “Motivating Example,” “Technical Experiment,” “Data Science,” “Benchmark,” “Field Experiment,” or “Interview”). In contrast, other sources report the use of two methods (as in [5], [12], [16], and [19], which mention combinations like “Questionnaire” and “Case Study” or “Technical Experiment” and “Questionnaire”), and yet another group of texts ([2], [4], and [8]) refer to three different evaluation methods (with names like “Focus Group,” “Interview,” “Argumentation,” “Technical Experiment,” “Motivating Example,” or “Controlled Experiment”). 

Thus, depending on which provided source is taken into account, the number of different evaluation methods applied by Georg Buchgeher to evaluate the property satisfaction is reported as one (see [1], [3], [7], [9]–[11], [13]–[14], [17]–[18], [21]–[29]), two ([5], [12], [16], [19]), or three ([2], [4], [8]).

On the one hand, several sources clearly state that only one evaluation method was applied—for example, evaluations using “Technical Experiment” are mentioned in [8], [12], [14], [26], and [27]. On the other hand, a number of contributions assert that two different evaluation methods were used (for instance, “Technical Experiment” together with “Argumentation” as noted in [1] and [2], or “Technical Experiment” together with “Questionnaire” as in [17] and [19]). Additionally, a few texts mention that three evaluation methods were applied ([13] and [25]).

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, there is no single consistent answer. The reported number of evaluation methods applied by Stefan Kugele ranges from one to two to three.

For example, one paper’s evaluation used the Interview method ([1] and [2]), another paper’s contribution was evaluated by means of a Focus Group ([5]), and yet another study is described as having applied two evaluation methods—Benchmark and Technical Experiment ([15]). This synthesis yields a total of four evaluation methods (Interview, Focus Group, Benchmark, and Technical Experiment) attributed in the provided texts to Ingo Weber’s work on Architecture Decision Making.

• Technical Experiment (as reported in [2])  
• Questionnaire (as reported in [3])  
• Case Study (as reported in [4] and [9])  
• Interview (as reported in [6])  
• Data Science (as reported in [10])

When we rank these in descending alphabetical order—from the method whose name begins with the letter closest to Z first to the one beginning with the letter closest to A—we obtain the following ranking:

1. Technical Experiment  
2. Questionnaire  
3. Interview  
4. Data Science  
5. Case Study

Each method is taken directly from the respective sources.

• Text [1] reports that the evaluation properties are “Product Quality” and “Performance efficiency” (in descending alphabetical order, “Product Quality” followed by “Performance efficiency”).  
• Text [2] lists “Quality in Use”, “Effectiveness” and “Efficiency” (with the descending order being “Quality in Use”, then “Effectiveness”, and finally “Efficiency”).  
• Text [3] indicates “Security” and “Functional Suitability” (ordered as “Security” then “Functional Suitability”).  
• Text [4] provides “Product Quality”, “Performance efficiency” and “Functional Suitability” (in descending order: “Product Quality”, “Performance efficiency” then “Functional Suitability”).  
• Text [5] points only to “Maintainability” (which, as the sole property, is trivially in descending order).  
• Text [6] gives “Product Quality” and “Functional Suitability” (with the descending order being “Product Quality” then “Functional Suitability”).  
• Text [7] mentions only “Product Quality” as the explicitly identified property.  
• Text [8] reports “Usability”, “Product Quality” and “Functional Suitability” (ordered descending as “Usability”, “Product Quality” then “Functional Suitability”).  
• Text [9] provides a broader list with “Satisfaction”, “Quality in Use”, “Performance efficiency”, “Functional Suitability” and “Efficiency” (descending alphabetically: “Satisfaction”, “Quality in Use”, “Performance efficiency”, “Functional Suitability”, and “Efficiency”).  
• Text [10] again cites “Product Quality” and “Functional Suitability” (ordered as “Product Quality” then “Functional Suitability”).

Because the question asks specifically for the evaluation properties investigated by Andreas Burger when applying the Technical Experiment method and then to list them in descending alphabetical order, one might expect a single agreed‐upon answer. However, none of the texts explicitly link all the reported properties to Andreas Burger, and the lists vary considerably among the sources.

In summary, according to the provided partial answers:

• Some sources (e.g., [1]) indicate the properties as “Product Quality” and “Performance efficiency.”  
• Others (e.g., [2], [9]) bring in properties such as “Quality in Use”, “Effectiveness”, “Efficiency”, “Satisfaction” and even more items.  
• Yet other texts (e.g., [3], [6], [10]) consistently mention “Functional Suitability” (often alongside “Product Quality”).  
• Finally, [8] introduces “Usability” and [5] identifies “Maintainability.”

Thus, while there is no single, consistent set extracted from all texts, the properties mentioned in association with the Technical Experiment evaluation method include at least the following (with each source’s order given in descending alphabetical order):

• “Product Quality” (mentioned in [1], [4], [6], [7], [10])  
• “Performance efficiency” (mentioned in [1], [4], [9])  
• “Quality in Use”, “Effectiveness” and “Efficiency” (from [2] and [9])  
• “Security” (from [3])  
• “Functional Suitability” (from [3], [4], [6], [8], [9], [10])  
• “Maintainability” (from [5])  
• “Usability” (from [8])  
• “Satisfaction” (from [9])

Because the texts do not agree on one comprehensive list linked uniquely to Andreas Burger’s application of the Technical Experiment method, the final answer depends on which subset of the texts one privileges. One relatively recurring grouping appears in texts [6] and [10] where “Product Quality” and “Functional Suitability” are reported (with descending order: “Product Quality” then “Functional Suitability”). In contrast, other sources provide longer lists.

Therefore, the answer is: There is no single final list that all sources agree upon. Depending on which partial answer is used, the evaluation properties (in descending alphabetical order) have been reported variously as:  
– “Product Quality” and “Performance efficiency” ([1]);  
– “Quality in Use”, “Effectiveness” and “Efficiency” ([2]);  
– “Security” and “Functional Suitability” ([3]);  
– “Product Quality”, “Performance efficiency” and “Functional Suitability” ([4]);  
– “Maintainability” ([5]);  
– “Product Quality” and “Functional Suitability” ([6], [10]);  
– “Product Quality” ([7]);  
– “Usability”, “Product Quality” and “Functional Suitability” ([8]); and  
– “Satisfaction”, “Quality in Use”, “Performance efficiency”, “Functional Suitability” and “Efficiency” ([9]).  

Each of these answers orders the properties in descending alphabetical order according to their respective property names.

This reflects the variability in the extracted data from the provided texts about the Technical Experiment method.

In contrast, almost all sources note that there is no clear evidence of Architecture Extraction being investigated in 2020—with the exception of [2], which mentions a 2020 paper that involves the research object. However, other sources ([1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]) consistently indicate that there is no information or clear evidence of its investigation in that year.

Therefore, the overall picture is that while 2018 saw several studies explicitly addressing Architecture Extraction, there is little to no consistent evidence that the same research object was investigated in papers published in 2020.

For example, sources [1] and [3] note a single study from 2018 that is explicitly associated with an “Architecture Pattern,” and similar conclusions are reached in sources [8], [10], [12], [14], [15], [16], [17], [20], and [21]. In contrast, although a number of works were published in 2020, the texts do not provide information detailing an investigation that explicitly targets architecture patterns in that year (as seen in sources [1], [2], [3], [12] among others). 

Thus, based on the texts provided:  
• In 2018, there is one investigation instance involving architecture patterns.  
• In 2020, there is no explicit investigation of architecture patterns.

On one hand, one passage [2] clearly states that the paper “Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis” published in 2020 employed the evaluation method Questionnaire. On the other hand, another passage [3] indicates that a paper published in 2021 (“Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems”) used the Questionnaire method, with no evidence of its use in any 2020 paper. Meanwhile, additional texts [1], [4], [5], [6], [7], and [8] either do not mention the Questionnaire method or refer to different evaluation methods. 

Thus, considering the two sources that explicitly mention its use, the evidence shows that Questionnaire is applied once in a 2020 paper (as per [2]) and once in a 2021 paper (as per [3]).

Most sources report that Uwe Zdun’s research objects are evaluated using one or more evaluation methods. However, some texts describe contributions where—at least in one description—the evaluation method is missing or explicitly “False.” In particular:

• Several sources ([2], [12], [25]) explain that while objects labeled First Research Object 2 are evaluated by one or more valid methods, in at least one paper the contribution designated as Second Research Object 2 was associated with an evaluation process whose evaluation method is marked as “False.” For example, [2] specifically notes that Second Research Object 2 (in a paper on semi‐automatic feedback for improving architecture conformance) employed an evaluation where the evaluation method was “False.”

• Other texts ([4] and [10]) mention a research object contribution referred to as “Paper Class 2” and note that it “is not evaluation research” (i.e. no evaluation method was applied).

• In addition, one source ([11]) reports that in one study there were contributions for which no evaluation method is mentioned at all—including research objects identified as “Architecture Analysis Method” and “Architecture Extraction.”

• Yet another source ([17]) indicates that two research object entities—“Reference Architecture” and “Architectural Aspects”—appear in the Research Object Lists with no evaluation method applied.

In summary, while many of Uwe Zdun’s research objects (often labeled First Research Object 2) are evaluated with established methods, the provided texts include several cases where no evaluation method has been applied. These include:
 – Second Research Object 2 (in some instances, as its evaluation method is explicitly marked as “False”) [2, 12, 25],
 – the contribution labeled “Paper Class 2” [4, 10],
 – as well as instances where contributions named “Architecture Analysis Method” and “Architecture Extraction” ([11]) or “Reference Architecture” and “Architectural Aspects” ([17]) are reported without any applied evaluation method.

Thus, according to the texts, these are the research objects investigated by Uwe Zdun for which no evaluation method has been applied.

The methods explicitly mentioned across the texts are as follows:

• Technical Experiment – mentioned in several instances (e.g. [1], [4], [5], [17], [19], [24], [27])  
• Case Study – indicated as being applied without a guideline in multiple cases (e.g. [2], [3], [6], [12], [13], [20], [22], [26], [30])  
• Motivating Example – used in evaluations reported without a guideline (e.g. [4], [16], [29])  
• Questionnaire – applied in evaluations without an accompanying guideline (e.g. [7], [9], [12], [23])  
• Controlled Experiment – mentioned as used without a guideline (e.g. [7], [11])  
• Argumentation – explicitly noted in instances with the guideline set to False (e.g. [8], [21], [25])  
• Verification – reported as used without a guideline (e.g. [15])  
• Focus Group – used in at least one evaluation instance without a guideline (e.g. [9], [18])  
• Interview – mentioned in connection with an evaluation that did not apply a guideline (e.g. [18])  
• Data Science – identified in one case where the evaluation was conducted without following an evaluation guideline (e.g. [28])

Each of these methods was employed within evaluations where the evaluation guideline was not applied, as explicitly indicated by the “Has Guideline: False” property in the source texts.

• First Research Object 2  
• Second Research Object 2

Several sources explicitly state that while a separate contribution (labeled Evidence 2) is described with properties related to input data (with values such as “used: False,” “not available,” or—even conflictingly—in one case “used: True”), neither First Research Object 2 nor Second Research Object 2 is described as using input data [1], [2], [5], [6], [9], [11].

Even where one publication provides additional detail by linking First Research Object 2 with entity names such as “Architecture Design Method,” “Architecture Analysis Method,” “Architecture Description Language,” or “Architectural Aspects” [3], [10], [11], [12], [17], [18], [19], [25], [27], [28], none of these descriptions include any indication of input data being used for the investigation of these objects.

Thus, the coherent final answer is:

The research objects investigated in publications from Davide Arcelli that have not used input data are First Research Object 2 and Second Research Object 2.

However, a number of the texts explicitly state that evaluations incorporate a property with a sub‑property construct that bears the name Functional Suitability (see, for example, [2], [15], [18], [19], [24], and [25]). Although other properties—such as Accuracy, Effectiveness, Product Quality, and others—are also mentioned, the frequency and explicit detail found in multiple sources indicate that Functional Suitability is the property that is evaluated most often.

Thus, the final answer is: Functional Suitability.

In contrast, several other texts mention “Technical Experiment” as an explicit evaluation method, but these instances are not linked to a contribution whose evaluated research object is explicitly “Architecture Extraction” (or the equivalent research object) or where the proposal of solution flag is confirmed as True.

Thus, when considering those papers that simultaneously have a proposal of solution (Paper Class 2 with that flag set to True) and investigate the research object Architecture Extraction (or a closely related entity), the only evaluation method explicitly mentioned is “Case Study” ([1], [2], [8], [21]). 

It is important to note, however, that while additional evaluation methods appear in the texts overall, none of them are explicitly connected to papers meeting both criteria as clearly as “Case Study.”

Some sources ([2], [3], and [5]) indicate that the work—whichever its title—was published in 2020 and evaluated with Argumentation. On the other hand, [4] explicitly names a research object published in 2019 undergoing an evaluation by Argumentation and does not mention any additional objects in 2020 or 2021. Despite this slight discrepancy regarding the specific publication year (2019 versus 2020), all sources converge on the point that only one such research object falls into the 2019–2021 period. Therefore, the final distribution is that one research object evaluated with the evaluation method Argumentation was published between 2019 and 2021 [1][2][3][4][5].

• In 2017 several publications are reported to have evaluated compatibility. For example, one 2017 publication applied evaluation methods including Argumentation, Technical Experiment, and Motivating Example [1]. Another 2017 work is described as having used Technical Experiment, Questionnaire, and Controlled Experiment [2]. Additional 2017 cases include a publication employing Verification and Technical Experiment [15], one applying Grounded Theory [16], another using Technical Experiment from an Evaluation Method List [17], a study evaluated with Field Experiment [18], and a publication that again adopted Technical Experiment [19].

• In 2019 multiple publications evaluated compatibility using a variety of methods. One publication (focused on “Mitigating the Influence of Embedded Software Development Environments and Toolsets (ESDT) on Software Architecture”) applied Technical Experiment [7]. Another project from 2019 employed Focus Group and Questionnaire [4], while a further publication used Technical Experiment in its evaluation [6]. In addition, a 2019 publication on agile architecting in automotive settings used Interview [8]; another reported using Questionnaire [9] and yet another explicitly applied Technical Experiment [10]. Evaluations in 2019 also include work that used a Case Study methodology [11, 14, 20], one evaluation that employed Motivating Example alongside properties like Functional Suitability and Product Quality [12], and a publication that used Field Experiment [13].

Thus, among publications that evaluate compatibility:
 – In 2017 the evaluation methods include Argumentation, Technical Experiment, Motivating Example, Questionnaire, Controlled Experiment, Verification, Grounded Theory, and Field Experiment [1, 2, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].
 – In 2019 the methods are distributed as Technical Experiment, Focus Group, Questionnaire, Interview, Case Study, Motivating Example (plus additional properties such as Functional Suitability and Product Quality), and Field Experiment [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20].

There is no explicit evidence in the provided texts about any evaluation methods applied in 2018.

One paper titled ""Incremental Calibration of Architectural Performance Models with Parametric Dependencies"" is clearly associated with the Architecture Evolution research object [1], and another, ""Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization,"" is also explicitly linked to architecture evolution [3]. 

While several other works published in 2020 are mentioned in the texts and fall broadly within the field of Software Architecture and Design, none of those sources explicitly state that the work investigates architecture evolution. Therefore, the final answer, based strictly on the explicit information provided, is that two papers investigate architecture evolution in 2020.

• Partial answer [1] asserts that “A Taxonomy of Blockchain‐Based Systems for Architecture Design” (published in 2017) is the only paper that both has Ingo Weber as an author and applies the evaluation method Argumentation.

• In contrast, partial answer [2] reports that “A Platform Architecture for Multi‐Tenant Blockchain‐Based Systems” (published in 2019) meets both conditions, ranking it first (and only) when ordered by descending publication year.

• The remaining partial answers ([3]–[6]) state that the other mentioned papers either use a different evaluation method (for example, Case Study, Interview) or do not include Ingo Weber as an author. In these texts it is concluded that no paper satisfies both criteria.

Thus, while two separate partial answers identify one paper each that meets the conditions—one paper from 2017 [1] and one paper from 2019 [2]—the other texts indicate that no paper satisfies both conditions. In summary, based solely on the provided texts there is a conflict: one source identifies a 2017 paper and another a 2019 paper as fulfilling both criteria, whereas the other texts dispute that any paper meets both criteria.

According to source [7], “Architectural Technical Debt: A Grounded Theory” (2020) is identified as validation research whose evaluation employs grounded theory. Likewise, source [1] indicates that “On Service-Orientation for Automotive Software” (2017) is also classified as validation research and is evaluated using grounded theory. Consequently, when sorting these publications from newest to oldest, the list is as follows:

1. Architectural Technical Debt: A Grounded Theory (2020) [7]
2. On Service-Orientation for Automotive Software (2017) [1]

It should be noted that several other texts (e.g., [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and so on) mention publications evaluated with grounded theory or classified as validation research but conclude that no publication meets both criteria. However, the two sources above are the only ones that explicitly report a publication fulfilling both properties.

Some sources claim that one paper investigating Architecture Evolution appears in a given year, while others indicate that the only such paper was published in a different year. For example, one group of texts indicates that the only paper related to Architecture Evolution was published in 2019, leaving both 2020 and 2021 with 0 papers [1, 4]. In contrast, another set of texts claims that a paper was published in 2021 investigating Architecture Evolution – for instance, “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” and “Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” are both cited with publication dates in 2021 [2, 3, 8]. Meanwhile, yet another group points to one paper in 2020 (e.g., “Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization,” “Incremental Calibration of Architectural Performance Models with Parametric Dependencies,” and “Butterfly Space: An Architectural Approach for Investigating Performance Issues”) with no corresponding paper in 2021 [5, 6, 9]. Finally, one source mentions a 2021 paper (“Architectural Decay as Predictor of Issue- and Change-Proneness”) though without explicit association to Architecture Evolution [7].

Thus, depending on which textual account is followed the number of papers investigating Architecture Evolution would be:
• According to sources [1] and [4]: 2020 – 0 papers; 2021 – 0 papers.
• According to sources [5], [6], and [9]: 2020 – 1 paper; 2021 – 0 papers.
• According to sources [2], [3], and [8]: 2020 – 0 papers; 2021 – 1 paper.
• Source [7] adds an additional claim for 2021 with 1 paper, though without clarifying its investigation of Architecture Evolution.

Because the provided texts do not consistently agree on which papers actually investigate Architecture Evolution in 2020 versus 2021, there is no single definitive answer. One must note these discrepancies when considering the final counts.

Several partial answers explicitly state that a paper investigating architecture decision making was published in 2021 with no corresponding paper in 2020 ([2], [7], [8], [9], [10], [22], [24]). In contrast, other partial answers indicate that a paper from 2020 exists with no corresponding paper in 2021 ([4], [12], [14], [16], [19], [20], [21], [23], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]). Other texts mention a publication from one of the years without clarifying its relation to architecture decision making ([1], [3], [5], [11], [13], [15], [17], [18]). 

Thus, based solely on the provided information, some texts support the idea that one paper on architecture decision making appears in 2021 and none in 2020, while other texts indicate the opposite. There is no clear, unified count of papers investigating architecture decision making in 2020 compared to 2021 according to the available sources.

• According to sources [1] and [4], there is one paper evaluating Maintainability in 2017 and no paper in 2020.

• Meanwhile, sources [2] and [3] indicate that one paper evaluates Maintainability in 2020 and none in 2017.

Additionally, sources [5] and [6] mention an evaluation of Maintainability occurring in 2018—with no explicit linkage to either 2017 or 2020.

Thus, the provided texts yield contradictory answers regarding the comparison between the two years.

• One paper is titled “Design Criteria to Architect Continuous Experimentimentation for Self-Driving Vehicles.” According to [4], although one source mentions input data is used (with the value “True”), other sources (texts [6] and [7]) explicitly state that input data is “not used.”

• Another paper is “Microservice Ambients: An Architectural Meta-Modelling Approach for Microservice Granularity.” As described in [5], while the contribution does include an element associated with input data, some sources mark it as not used (input data flagged False or noted as not available), supporting the interpretation that input data was not effectively used.

Thus, based on the explicit information provided in [4] and [5], these two papers meet all three criteria (published in 2017, investigating the research object “Architecture Design Method,” and not using input data).

Several works are described as investigating architecture decision making and, according to multiple sources, have their Evidence 2 contribution use input data that is not available (i.e. “available” is explicitly set to False) and were published in 2018. For example:

• The paper titled ""Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events: A Qualitative Multi-method Study"" is explicitly associated with architecture decision making and is reported to have its input data not available [1].

• ""Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context"" investigates architecture decision making and includes explicit statements that its Evidence 2 contribution uses input data that is not available [2].

• ""Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision-Making in an Agile Context"" is also described as investigating architecture decision making, was published in 2018, and includes explicit evidence that its input data is not available [9].

• Similarly, ""Abstraction Layered Architecture: Writing Maintainable Embedded Code"" and ""Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared"" are presented as papers concerned with architectural (and by extension, architectural decision making) topics and are noted—through their Evidence 2 attributes—to have input data that is not available in 2018 [16] [17].

It should be noted that while some papers (and in some cases even within the same paper) are reported with conflicting remarks on input data availability, the synthesis above focuses on those instances where explicit statements indicate that input data is not available. Thus, based on the provided texts, the papers that investigate architecture decision making and have their input data marked as not available in 2018 include:

 – ""Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events: A Qualitative Multi-method Study"" [1]  
 – ""Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context"" [2]  
 – ""Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision-Making in an Agile Context"" [9]  
 – ""Abstraction Layered Architecture: Writing Maintainable Embedded Code"" [16]  
 – ""Two Architectural Threat Analysis Techniques Compared"" [17]

These are the works that explicitly meet both criteria according to the provided evidence.

• As noted in [7], ""Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study"" was published in 2017 and evaluated with the Focus Group method.

Several sources explicitly classify 2019 contributions—such as those in [1], [5], [22], and many others—as belonging to Paper Class 2. Notably, while most texts do not clearly state that grounded theory was applied for evaluation, one contribution ([22]) explicitly notes that Grounded Theory was used. Therefore, the most frequent paper class for 2019 publications (including those that applied grounded theory for evaluation) is Paper Class 2.

• Several sources ([1], [3], [4], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [15], [20], [21], [23], [25]) explicitly indicate that one paper investigating the research object Architecture Extraction (or, in very closely related contexts, contributions dealing with architectural aspects) was published in 2018.  
• In contrast, other sources ([2], [5], [6], [11], [13], [14], [16], [17], [19], [22]) mention papers published in 2020; however, these are either associated with different research objects or explicitly state that no paper investigating Architecture Extraction was published in 2018.

Thus, when focusing exclusively on papers investigating the research object Architecture Extraction, the explicit information shows the existence of one relevant paper published in 2018 and no paper explicitly reporting to investigate Architecture Extraction published in 2020.

Some sources consistently report that one paper investigating the object architecture description was published in 2018 with no corresponding publications in 2019 or 2020 ([1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [10], [17], [18], [20], [21], [22], [24]). In contrast, a different set of sources indicates that the only paper on this topic was published in 2020—with no such paper detected for 2018 (or 2019) ([4], [8], [9], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [19], [23], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]). 

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, the investigation of the object architecture description appears to be represented by a single paper in one of the two distinct years—either 2018 or 2020—while no papers from 2019 are mentioned. The final answer therefore depends on which set of texts is given precedence, but the overall picture is that only one paper is identified in the timeframe, with the year of publication being either 2018 or 2020 according to the respective sources.
