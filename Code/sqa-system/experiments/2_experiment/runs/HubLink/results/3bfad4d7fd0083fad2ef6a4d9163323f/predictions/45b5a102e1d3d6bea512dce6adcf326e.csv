For example, the paper on agile architecting in automotive systems [1] is shown in one text as Secondary Research but in another environment as Primary Research. Similarly, the papers “Guidelines for Architecting Android Apps: A Mixed-Method Empirical Study” [3] and “Assessing Architecture Conformance to Coupling-Related Patterns and Practices in Microservices” [4] are also inconsistently classified across different texts. All remaining papers are consistently described as Primary Research, Evaluation Research, or Validation Research with no unequivocal attribution to Secondary Research. 

Thus, considering all the provided partial answers, no paper is reliably and exclusively identified as having the research level of Secondary Research.

According to [1], the paper “Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures” is explicitly identified as a Personal Experience Paper and was published in 2018. In contrast, [2] presents “Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks” as being classified as a Personal Experience Paper, with a publication year of 2017. Furthermore, [3] states that there is no explicit evidence indicating that any paper has the Personal Experience Paper classification.

Thus, based solely on the information provided:
• [1] identifies “Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures” (2018) as a Personal Experience Paper.
• [2] identifies “Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks” (2017) as a Personal Experience Paper.
• [3] does not confirm any paper under the Personal Experience Paper classification.

If we consider sources [1] and [2] to be valid, then the ranked list in descending order by publication year is as follows:
1. “Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures” (2018) [1]
2. “Towards a Reference Architecture for Cloud-Based Plant Genotyping and Phenotyping Analysis Frameworks” (2017) [2]

However, note that [3] raises doubt about whether there is any paper with the Personal Experience Paper classification at all.

However, only one partial answer explicitly addresses the paper “Predicting the Performance of Privacy-Preserving Data Analytics Using Architecture Modelling and Simulation” by stating that its threats to validity are internal validity and external validity [1]. Although another source ([3]) lists additional kinds of threats (including a general threat to validity and issues related to repeatability and construct validity), that source does not clearly specify that these additional threats apply to the “Predicting the Performance…” paper. Furthermore, the other partial answers ([2] and [4]) refer to different papers.

Thus, based exclusively on the information clearly linked to the paper in question, the paper discusses internal validity and external validity as threats to validity [1].

Two sources ([1] and [2]) indicate that the paper evaluated properties related to functional and quality aspects. In particular, [1] states that the evaluated properties were Functional Suitability, Product Quality, and Satisfaction (with [1] explicitly giving their descending alphabetical order as Satisfaction, Product Quality, Functional Suitability), whereas [2] confirms the evaluation of Functional Suitability and Product Quality. In contrast, [3] describes a different study (with a title that suggests another work) that evaluated five properties: Accuracy, Quality of Method, Input data is available, Tool was used but is not available, and External Validity, ranked in descending alphabetical order as “Tool was used but is not available,” “Quality of Method,” “Input data is available,” “External Validity,” and “Accuracy.”

Since the question refers specifically to the paper titled “Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns,” and two of the partial answers ([1] and [2]) address evaluation properties for that work, the properties that were evaluated in that paper can be identified as Functional Suitability, Product Quality, and Satisfaction. When these are ranked in descending alphabetical order, the order is:

 • Satisfaction  
 • Product Quality  
 • Functional Suitability

Thus, according to [1] (and supported by [2]), the evaluated properties in the specified paper are as listed above.

• For the year 2020, António Silva is explicitly connected with papers that each contribute one research object (namely, Classifications_1). Based on multiple sources, his work in that year is associated with one research object overall [1][2][4].

• For 2021, one paper attributed to António Silva (""Trace Link Recovery for Software Architecture Documentation"") contributed one research object (Architecture Analysis Method) [11].

• Although there are several papers from 2018 (and from 2019) each associated with one research object (Classifications_1), none of the texts explicitly link these investigations to António Silva. Therefore, we do not have clear evidence that António Silva investigated research objects in those publication years [3][5][7][10] (and [6][8][9] for 2019).

Thus, based on the explicit information provided:
– In 2020, António Silva’s work investigated one research object.
– In 2021, António Silva’s work investigated one research object.
– No explicit evidence is given that António Silva investigated any research objects in 2018 (or in 2019).

• In 2020 there are two papers by Mauro Caporuscio. One paper (“Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization”) employs one evaluation method (a case study) [1], and another (“Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly”) employs one evaluation method (a technical experiment) [3]. This gives a total of 2 evaluation methods for 2020.

• In 2021 the paper “A Machine Learning Approach to Service Discovery for Microservice Architectures” is explicitly attributed to Mauro Caporuscio and employs one evaluation method (a technical experiment) [2].

Other partial answers mention evaluation methods for various publication years, but they do not provide explicit evidence that Mauro Caporuscio is among the authors. Therefore, based on the confirmed evidence the answer is: 

For 2020, there are 2 evaluation methods applied and for 2021, there is 1 evaluation method applied [1], [2], [3].

Note that the texts do not all agree—some report only a single method by name while others list multiple evaluation properties or methods that can be interpreted as “evaluation approaches.” We present the reported numbers along with the source identifiers for each year.

• 2017  
 – One source [9] reports that the paper “Continuous Analysis of Collaborative Design” was evaluated using three approaches (Technical Experiment, Controlled Experiment, and Questionnaire).  
 – Another source [12] reports two approaches (a Technical Experiment and the Argumentation method).  
 – Yet another source [22] describes three methods (Focus Group, Interview, and Questionnaire).  
 – A different source [24] reports a single approach (Technical Experiment).  
 – One report [26] aggregates six different evaluation aspects (Benchmark, Technical Experiment, Product Quality, Quality of Method, Performance efficiency, and Accuracy).  

• 2018  
 – One source [2] recounts eight evaluation approaches in “Recovering Architectural Design Decisions” (Technical Experiment, Product Quality, Functional Suitability, Quality of Method, Evaluation Research, Effectiveness, Quality in Use, and Accuracy).  
 – In contrast, another source [4] mentions only one approach (Case Study) for an 2018 paper.  
 – A further source [23] indicates two methods (Interview and Questionnaire).  
 – Yet another source [25] states that two approaches (Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment) were applied.  
 – Finally, source [28] reports two methods (Interview and Field Experiment).  

• 2019  
 – Two sources ([3] and [14]) each document one approach, namely the Case Study method (for “Continuous Adaptation Management in Collective Intelligence Systems” and “Tool Support for the Migration to Microservice Architecture: An Industrial Case Study,” respectively).  
 – In contrast, source [16] interprets the evaluation for a 2019 paper as involving five distinct evaluation-related specifications (False, True, Effectiveness, Functional Suitability, and Questionnaire).  
 – Additionally, source [17] confirms one approach (Case Study) and source [19] reports one approach (Benchmark).  

• 2020  
 – One source [5] reports one evaluation approach (Case Study) in “Butterfly Space: An Architectural Approach for Investigating Performance Issues.”  
 – Source [8] also reports one approach for “Technical Architectures for Automotive Systems” (Focus Group).  
 – However, source [15] documents two evaluation approaches (Technical Experiment and Controlled Experiment) in “DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions.”  
 – Also, source [21] indicates that two approaches (Argumentation and Technical Experiment) were applied.  

• 2021  
 – Two sources ([1] and [6]) each report one approach using a Case Study (for “Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” and “Trace Link Recovery for Software Architecture Documentation,” respectively).  
 – Source [7] again confirms one approach (Case Study).  
 – Source [10] describes two evaluation approaches (Technical Experiment and Questionnaire) for “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems.”  
 – Source [11] lists four evaluation‐related specifications (False, Effectiveness, Case Study, and Quality in Use) for “Identifying Domain‐Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors.”  
 – Source [13] reports two approaches (Focus Group and Interview) in a 2021 paper.  
 – Finally, source [18] confirms one approach (Case Study) and source [27] also states one (Technical Experiment).  

In summary, the data from the provided texts for the papers published by Danny Weyns report varying numbers of evaluation approaches per year, with counts as follows according to different sources:

– 2017: reported counts range from 1 to 6 evaluation approaches.  
– 2018: reported counts range from 1 to 8 evaluation approaches.  
– 2019: reported counts range from 1 to 5 evaluation approaches.  
– 2020: reported counts range from 1 to 2 evaluation approaches.  
– 2021: reported counts range from 1 to 4 evaluation approaches.  

Each group of texts (identified by [1] through [28]) provides a different perspective on the number of evaluation approaches applied, reflecting differences in which evaluation aspects (methods, sub‐properties, or guidelines) are counted as distinct approaches.

• According to [1], “ACE: Easy Deployment of Field Optimization Experiments” uses Field Experiment as its evaluation method.  
• [2] explicitly states that “Decision Models for Microservices: Design Areas, Stakeholders, Use Cases, and Requirements” applies Field Experiment.  
• [3] indicates that “An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots” is described as using Field Experiment according to one text, though another text about the same work indicates it was evaluated using Interviews, resulting in conflicting descriptions.

The other sources ([4] and [5]) do not provide support for any paper evaluated using Field Experiment.

• Similarly, [8] (""An Exploratory Study on Architectural Knowledge in Issue Tracking Systems"") is described as having a contribution both evaluated for Functional Suitability and using available input data.

• In [10] (""Continuous Adaptation Management in Collective Intelligence Systems""), the contribution both assesses the Functional Suitability and employs available input data.

• Publication [11] (""Infrastructure-as-Code for Data-Intensive Architectures: A Model-Driven Development Approach"") makes its input data available and evaluates its contribution under the Functional Suitability sub‐property.

• The work in [12] (""Preventing Erosion in Exception Handling Design Using Static-Architecture Conformance Checking"") also meets the criteria, with a contribution evaluated for Functional Suitability and using available input data.

• [13] (""Trace Link Recovery for Software Architecture Documentation"") is another publication having a component evaluated based on Functional Suitability and using available input data.

• Publication [14] (""From a Monolith to a Microservices Architecture: An Approach Based on Transactional Contexts"") both assesses functional suitability of a reference architecture and provides input data.

• The work mentioned in [15] (""Decentralized Architecture for Energy-Aware Service Assembly"") evaluates its reference architecture’s Functional Suitability and makes available the input data.

• [16] (""Continuous Analysis of Collaborative Design"") contributes through a component that is evaluated for Functional Suitability while using available input data.

• Publication [17] (""Monolith Migration Complexity Tuning Through the Application of Microservices Patterns"") also meets both criteria with its evaluation and input data availability.

• In [18] (""A Runtime Safety Enforcement Approach by Monitoring and Adaptation""), the publication uses available input data and assesses functional suitability.

• [19] (""A Complexity Metric for Microservices Architecture Migration"") contributes with a component using available input data and is explicitly associated with Functional Suitability.

• The work in [20] (""Determination and Enforcement of Least-Privilege Architecture in Android"") fulfills the criteria by evaluating its contribution under Functional Suitability and employing available input data.

• Finally, [21] (""DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions"") similarly evaluates its contribution via Functional Suitability and makes its input data available.

The majority of the texts ([1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [16], [17], [18], [20], [21], [22]) state that although some papers discuss repeatability as a validity threat, none of these papers use interviews as part of their evaluation. In contrast, three texts ([5], [15], [19]) each report one paper—in different studies—that discusses repeatability as a validity threat and employs interviews in its evaluation. 

Thus, while most sources indicate that 0 papers use interviews in the evaluation, a minority of sources claim that 1 paper does. The final answer depends on which texts one regards as most authoritative, but based solely on the provided texts there is an inconsistency: the prevailing evidence suggests 0, but three entries claim there is 1.

• Four sources ([1], [2], [5], [6]) report that there is one publication that uses Grounded Theory for evaluation and that it employs input data that is publicly available.  
• Three sources ([3], [4], [7]) report that there is one publication using Grounded Theory that uses input data which is not publicly available.

Thus, among the publications that use Grounded Theory for evaluation, one paper is reported to have publicly available input data and one paper is reported not to have publicly available input data.

66,45b5a102e1d3d6bea512dce6adcf326e,cb20ce38-aaad-4b13-b082-7594e50e35f1,"Below is a synthesis of the information from the various texts:

• One set of texts (for example, [1]) indicates that a paper in the Architecture Design Method category was evaluated with respect to Portability but does not report any evaluation of Usability.  
• In contrast, several texts ([2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [10], and [11]) report that a paper was evaluated with respect to Usability but that no paper was evaluated with respect to Portability.  
• Two texts ([5] and [8]) report that, in a given study, one paper was evaluated for Portability and the same paper was also evaluated for Usability.  
• Finally, one text ([9]) does not mention an evaluation of either property.

Thus, the provided partial answers are not entirely consistent. In summary, depending on the source, the papers investigating Architecture Design Method have been reported as follows:
– Some evidence shows 1 paper evaluated Portability and 0 papers evaluated Usability ([1]).  
– Other evidence shows 0 papers evaluated Portability and 1 paper evaluated Usability ([2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [10], [11]).  
– Yet additional evidence reports 1 paper evaluated each property ([5], [8]).  

Because different texts provide different accounts, the final answer is that the evaluations reported for the properties are contradictory across the provided sources.

• One paper is evaluated in terms of usability without any mention of portability ([1]).  
• Another paper is evaluated for portability only ([2]).  
• One paper (in [3]) includes one contribution for usability and one for portability.  
• One paper focuses solely on portability ([4]).  
• One paper examines usability only ([5]).  
• One paper combines evaluation of both usability and portability ([6]).  
• One paper focuses on usability only ([7]).  
• One paper focuses on portability only ([8]).  
• One paper examines usability only ([9]).  
• One paper evaluates usability only ([10]).  
• One paper is associated with usability only ([11]).  
• One paper focuses on usability only ([12]).  
• One study shows an aspect of usability only ([13]).  
• One paper is evaluated in terms of a usability-related property only ([14]).  
• And finally, one paper focuses on usability only ([15]).  

If we interpret each paper as a distinct instance, we can count 12 instances where usability is explicitly the focus ([1], [3], [5], [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]) and 5 instances where portability is explicitly the focus ([2], [3], [4], [6], [8]). 

Thus, among papers that investigate a reference architecture, the provided texts indicate that usability is the focus in 12 instances compared to 5 instances for portability.

• Additionally, [4] states that “Modeling of Parametric Dependencies for Performance Prediction of Component-Based Software Systems at Run-Time” is linked to the research object Architecture Optimization Method and similarly notes that no input data was used.

No other paper combines both the focus on an Architecture Optimization Method and the explicit statement regarding the absence of input data.

For example, one paper (discussed in [4]) meets both criteria and is classified as Evaluation Research, and another work (discussed in [12]) has instances of both Validation Research and Proposal of Solution. Some texts (such as [1], [7], and parts of [2]) associate the Case Study method with Evaluation Research, while other texts (like [3], [8], and [11]) explicitly mention Proposal of Solution, and still others ([5] and parts of [12]) indicate Validation Research.  

However, when focusing on the contribution where a paper both clearly applies the Case Study method and investigates an Architecture Description—as evidenced, for instance, in [4]—the paper class most explicitly associated with that combination is Evaluation Research.  

Thus, based on the provided texts, the most used paper class for papers that apply the evaluation method Case Study and investigate the research object Architecture Description is Evaluation Research [1][4][7].

74,45b5a102e1d3d6bea512dce6adcf326e,dd9b02a6-7f62-4bec-91dd-330398852334,"Based on the provided texts, the clear consensus for publications that investigate architecture patterns with evaluations based on case studies is that the most used paper class is consistently identified by the identifier Classifications_1. Several sources explicitly state that when a work investigates architecture patterns and employs case studies (or related evaluation approaches) in its evaluation, its contribution is associated with Classifications_1. For example, [1], [2], [4], [5], [7], [8], [9], and [10] all clearly link the usage of case studies with contributions identified as Classifications_1. Although a few texts (such as [3], [6], [11], [13], [20], [21], [22], [23]) refer to specific labels like ""Evaluation Research"" or ""Proposal of Solution"" in conjunction with or as descriptors for Classifications_1, the dominant and most frequently mentioned paper class among these publications remains Classifications_1.

Thus, the final answer is: Among the publications that investigate architecture patterns and apply case studies in their evaluation, the most used paper class is Classifications_1 [1][2][4][5][7][8][9][10].

For example, [1], [4], [6], [8], [9], [16], and [20] all indicate that the contribution is classified as Evaluation Research. Although some sources (e.g., [2], [7], [14], [21], [22], [23], and [25]) refer to a common label (Classifications_1), these sources either do not explicitly state the underlying paper class or later equate their contribution with Evaluation Research or a similar category. Therefore, based on the explicit information provided, Evaluation Research emerges as the most used paper class in this context [1][4][6][8][9][16][20].

Instead, the texts cite individual instances of one paper per various years—such as in 2017 [1][2], 2018 [5][6][11][24][25], 2019 [3][7][19][21][22][26][27], 2020 [4][17][23], and 2021 [9][10][12][13][15][16][18][20]—but they do not supply any data that would allow us to determine a recurring annual frequency or trend. Therefore, while specific examples are mentioned for several years, no explicit information is provided that establishes a broader per‐year frequency for papers investigating architectural assumptions.

In several cases this contribution is described in terms of its architectural roles (such as an architecture design method, architecture analysis method, architecture decision making, or even architectural assumptions and evolution) [1], [2], [4], [6], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Although some papers incorporate evaluations using techniques like technical experiments, case studies, or questionnaires and mention properties such as product quality, quality of method, performance efficiency, or functional suitability, none of the texts explicitly indicate that reliability itself is being evaluated. 

Thus, while the evaluation research papers investigate various evaluation aspects related to “Classifications_1,” there is no explicit focus on reliability in these descriptions.

• A Case Study approach – as noted in several sources ([1], [2], [11], [13], [14], [15], [17], [24], [25], [28], [29], [21]).  
• A Technical Experiment – reported in a number of papers ([3], [4], [5], [16]).  
• A Motivating Example – mentioned in multiple texts ([6], [12], [19], [22], [23]).  
• An Interview – used in some works ([7], [10]).  
• A Field Experiment – described in one paper alongside the Interview ([10]).  
• A Data Science evaluation method – explicitly featured in one context ([8]).  
• A Focus Group – applied in at least one study ([9], [30]).  
• An Argumentation Approach – used in the context of one contribution ([20]).  
• Grounded Theory – reported as the evaluation method for one classification ([27]).  

Each of these methods is accompanied, in various cases, by additional evaluation properties (for example, Quality in Use, Functional Suitability, Quality of Method, accuracy, or context-related aspects), but as far as the evaluation methods themselves, the above list represents the range of approaches used to evaluate compatibility across the provided papers.

• Text [1] indicates that only one evaluation method, the Motivating Example, is explicitly connected with evaluating the property Freedom from Risk.  
• In contrast, text [2] explains that the study uses two methods—Focus Group and Interview—but it does not state explicitly that these methods were used to evaluate Freedom from Risk, only that they are part of the study alongside this sub-property.

Thus, while one method is explicitly tied to Freedom from Risk (Motivating Example), the study itself involves two evaluation methods (Focus Group and Interview) whose connection to Freedom from Risk is not clearly specified.

For example, several sources indicate that a single method—whether identified as a Case Study [1], Technical Experiment [12], or Motivating Example [15]—is used, and no additional distinct evaluation methods are clearly tied to evaluating reliability [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [9], [11], [13], [14], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Although one text [4] mentions two methods (an interview and a field experiment) in connection with the overall contribution evaluation, it does not explicitly link both methods to the evaluation of reliability. Therefore, based solely on the provided texts, only one evaluation method is explicitly described for evaluating reliability.

• One paper explicitly evaluating Reliability is described in [1]. According to that source, the evaluation methods applied for its Reliability assessment are identified as “Interview” and “Field Experiment.” When ranked in descending alphabetical order by their first letter, the order is:

  Interview, Field Experiment. [1]

• Another source [2] confirms that although Reliability is explicitly evaluated, it does not specify any evaluation method directly linked to that property.

• Additionally, [3] refers to a paper evaluating Reliability where additional evaluation methods—“Technical Experiment” and “Argumentation”—are mentioned. However, [3] emphasizes that there is no explicit statement linking either of those methods to the Reliability evaluation.

Thus, while [1] provides clear evaluation methods for Reliability (Interview and Field Experiment, ranked in descending alphabetical order), [2] and [3] indicate that in other cases no explicit evaluation method for the Reliability property is directly connected.

Keep in mind that while not every text explicitly links its evaluation method to the freedom‑from‑risk investigation, the following methods have been reported in papers where such an evaluation is described:

• Technical Experiment (cited in [1], [5], and [11])  
• Questionnaire (cited in [7] and [8])  
• Interview (cited in [3])  
• Focus Group (cited in [3])  
• Case Study (cited in [2], [6], [8], [9], and [10])  
• Benchmark (cited in [5])  
• Argumentation (cited in [11])  

When these methods are ranked in descending alphabetical order (from Z to A), the order is:

1. Technical Experiment  
2. Questionnaire  
3. Interview  
4. Focus Group  
5. Case Study  
6. Benchmark  
7. Argumentation  

Each of these entries reflects how various studies (or texts) have realized the evaluation, as reported by the respective sources.

In some instances, a paper is described where both properties are evaluated once—indicating an equal frequency (see [1], [2], [6], and [8]). However, several other texts describe contributions in which only one of the properties is explicitly evaluated—for example, one instance where only Context Coverage is evaluated ([3], [4], [7], [11]) and other instances where only Satisfaction is evaluated ([5], [9], [10], [12], [13]). 

Thus, based solely on the available information, there is no uniform pattern. In certain contributions the evaluation frequency is equal (one time each), while in others only one property is assessed. Consequently, the evidence does not allow us to conclude that the property Satisfaction is evaluated more or less frequently than Context Coverage in papers investigating Architecture Evolution.

In some cases, both evaluation sub-properties are used equally. For example, in publications such as “A Decision Model for Choosing Patterns in Blockchain‐Based Applications” [1], “On Service‐Orientation for Automotive Software” [3], “Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context” [8], “Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games” [10], and several others [4], [5], [6], [7], the same contribution (namely Classifications₁) is evaluated once by using a sub-property related to context coverage and once by using a sub-property related to satisfaction. In these instances, satisfaction is evaluated as often as context coverage.

However, there are also instances where only one of the two aspects is explicitly evaluated. In some publications, only context coverage is reported (e.g., “How Software Architects Focus Their Attention” [2] and “View‐Centric Context Modeling to Foster the Engineering of Cyber‐Physical System Networks” [9] show evaluations related to context coverage with no corresponding information on satisfaction). Conversely, there are works where only satisfaction is evaluated (as seen in “Migrating Towards Microservice Architectures: An Industrial Survey” [16], “Identifying and Prioritizing Architectural Debt Through Architectural Smells: A Case Study in a Large Software Company” [13], and “Microservice Architecture in Reality: An Industrial Inquiry” [12], with additional confirmation in [11]). There is also a case [14] where no evidence of context coverage is provided, making a comparison impossible.

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, while in several instances satisfaction and context coverage are each evaluated once, overall there is inconsistency across the literature: some studies evaluate both properties equally, while others address only one of the evaluation sub-properties.

• Some publications evaluate only usability without mentioning maintainability (as seen in [1], [3], [5], [6], [8], and [9]).  
• Other publications report evaluating both usability and maintainability equally (with one evaluation each), for example in [2], [4], and [10].  
• One source ([7]) indicates an evaluation of maintainability only, without explicit mention of usability.

Thus, while there are a few cases where both usability and maintainability are assessed equally, the overall tendency among the examined controlled experiments is that usability is more frequently evaluated (with several cases reporting usability alone) compared to maintainability.

Note that although the question names Technical Debt as the research object, none of the texts explicitly address Technical Debt. Instead, the texts describe evaluations on other research objects, so this summary focuses solely on the properties that are evaluated (in the absence of a guideline) as reported by the texts:

• In several cases the evaluation guideline is explicitly not applied (the “has evaluation guideline” field is False) [1], [2], [7], [10], [14], [16], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [25].  
• With no overarching guideline in place, the studies still assess various evaluation sub‐properties. These include aspects such as Maintainability [1], Functional Suitability [3], Effectiveness [7], Performance efficiency [11], Accuracy [17], Satisfaction [22], and even Recovery or Freedom from Risk [10], [22].  
• In addition, several evaluation properties are measured. Among these are Product Quality [1], Quality in Use [5], Quality of Method [6], and in one instance even a default “False” value is reported for an evaluation property (which can be seen as an absence of a designated property) [19].  
• Finally, some studies also refer to related characteristics such as Portability [9] and Usability [9] as properties under evaluation.

Thus, when papers investigate a research object without adhering to an evaluation guideline the explicit properties evaluated (as extracted from the texts) include one or more of the following: Maintainability, Functional Suitability, Effectiveness, Performance efficiency, Accuracy, Product Quality, Quality in Use, Quality of Method, Portability, Usability, as well as additional aspects like Freedom from Risk, Satisfaction, and Recovery. These properties (often coupled with the specification of evaluation methods such as technical experiments, case studies, focus groups, or questionnaires and a classification as Evaluation Research) are the ones that are reported in the provided texts [1], [2], [3], [7], [9], [10], [11], [14], [16], [19], [21], [22], [23], [25].

It is important to note that even though the question asks about Technical Debt, none of the texts explicitly connect these evaluation properties to research on Technical Debt.

Several publications on architectural assumptions report that their contributions (all lumped under the “Classifications_1” label in many cases) were evaluated without an overall evaluation guideline. In these cases, the settings indicate that the overall “Evaluation Guideline” and/or the “Referenced Threats to Validity Guideline” were explicitly set to False. In addition, individual evaluation aspects were examined in this “no-guideline” context. For example, some publications evaluated properties such as:

• Accuracy, Quality of Method, and Product Quality (as noted in texts [3], [7], [11], [19]).  
• Performance efficiency (see texts [3] and [22]).  
• Functional Suitability and Effectiveness (as described in texts [8], [9], and [22]).  
• Context coverage and, in one instance, even aspects such as the use of the Questionnaire method and non-use of tool support (see text [27]).  
• Threats to validity aspects (for example, regarding Internal or External Validity or, in some cases, Construct Validity) were evaluated without a formal guideline, as indicated by an explicitly false “Referenced Threats to Validity Guideline” (texts [1], [14], [15], [16], [24], and [28]).  
• Additional properties like Recovery (text [4]) and maintainability (text [12]) were also reported without adherence to any evaluation guideline in some studies.

Moreover, a number of studies report that even the evaluation sub-properties (the detailed aspects of a property) and the chosen evaluation methods themselves (such as Technical Experiment, Focus Group, Interview, Case Study, Questionnaire, or even the use of Grounded Theory) were applied in a setting where no formal guideline was used ([6], [13], [20], [25], [29]). 

Thus, among publications investigating architectural assumptions, the properties that have been evaluated without following a guideline include – depending on the study – the overall evaluation (i.e. the evaluation guideline itself being set to False), as well as concrete properties such as Accuracy, Quality of Method, Product Quality, Performance efficiency, Functional Suitability, Effectiveness, Security, Context coverage, and various threats to validity (internal, external, or construct), along with the evaluation methods employed. These differences are observed in multiple contributions where the flag for following a guideline is explicitly set to False ([1], [3], [4], [7], [8], [9], [11], [13], [14], [16], [19], [20], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]).

The prevailing evidence indicates that there is no research object that is simultaneously evaluated without an evaluation guideline and with the Field Experiment method.

Several publications that report using grounded theory in their evaluations have contributed a research object (always labeled as Classifications_1) for which no evaluation guideline is used (that is, both “Evaluation Guideline” and “Referenced Threats to Validity Guideline” are set to False). In these cases the research object is further characterized in terms of its specific architectural focus. For example:

• In some publications Classifications_1 represents aspects such as an Architecture Pattern [1, 2, 9] or Architectural Assumptions [7].  
• In others it is described in relation to decision‐making processes or design approaches adopted in architecture—for instance, as Architecture Decision Making [6, 11], Architecture Design Method [15, 16], Architecture Analysis Method [18, 24, 26], or even as an Architecture Optimization Method [22, 23, 25].  
• At least one instance associates Classifications_1 with “Architectural Aspects” in the context of investigating performance issues [5].

Thus, among publications that apply grounded theory in their evaluation and do not use an evaluation guideline, the evaluated research objects are contributed as Classifications_1 and are variously framed as representing architecture patterns, design methods, decision‐making approaches, analysis methods, optimization methods, or other architectural properties.

For example, one paper explicitly noted that “The Evolution of Technical Debt in the Apache Ecosystem” used a Data Science–rooted evaluation method ([2]). Furthermore, another text reviewing a work on Technical Debt (in “Architectural Decay as Predictor of Issue- and Change-Proneness”) also pointed out that Data Science was the only explicitly identified evaluation method ([9]). Although one text ([1]) mentioned a paper on Technical Debt that employed Grounded Theory, the information from [2] and [9] indicates that Data Science is the evaluation method most often applied in papers investigating Technical Debt.

Thus, based on the provided excerpts, the evaluation method applied the most is Data Science ([2], [9]).

For example, one study addresses Technical Debt by focusing on predictors such as issue‐ and change-proneness and then evaluates these using measures like accuracy and quality of method [1]. Other investigations have examined Technical Debt indirectly by evaluating properties like product quality and maintainability [2, 3]. In addition, some works also consider functional suitability as well as evaluation sub-properties such as efficiency, accuracy, and quality in use [5, 6, 7]. 

Beyond these primary investigation targets, several studies include additional properties related to how research is evaluated and reported. These include evaluation guidelines (or the lack thereof), the presence or absence of input data and replication packages, as well as broader aspects like the classification of research level (e.g., Primary Research or Evaluation Research) and the use of tool support [4, 8, 9]. 

Thus, the most frequently investigated properties concerning Technical Debt (or, in closely related studies, research contributions akin to Technical Debt) are:
• Issue‐ and change-proneness  
• Accuracy and quality of the employed method  
• Product quality and maintainability  
• Functional suitability, efficiency, and quality in use  
• And, in some cases, evaluation-specific aspects such as guidelines, research classification, and tool support

Each of these properties provides insights into both the technical and evaluative dimensions of Technical Debt research as reflected in the provided texts [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

Although no numeric frequency is provided, the following properties recur most often:

• The property “Quality in Use” appears repeatedly as an explicit evaluation criterion ([1], [2], [6], [7], [10], [19], [20], [29], [30]).  
• The property “Product Quality” is also frequently evaluated, sometimes together with its related sub-property “Functional Suitability” ([4], [15], [18], [22], [23], [24], [26], [28]).  
• The property “Quality of Method” and the associated sub-properties “Accuracy” (or simply Accuracy) are mentioned in several instances ([3], [5], [13], [21], [25]).  
• In addition, certain sub-properties such as “Effectiveness” (or its related notion in performance evaluations, e.g. “Performance efficiency”) are also highlighted ([2], [7], [11], [16], [21], [29], [30]).  

Thus, among publications investigating architectural assumptions, the most often evaluated properties explicitly mentioned across the texts are “Quality in Use,” “Product Quality” (often along with “Functional Suitability”), and aspects related to “Quality of Method” (including “Accuracy”) with “Effectiveness” (or similarly defined performance sub-properties) also featuring prominently ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [10], [11], [13], [16], [17], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [28], [29], [30]).

Thus, per publication year, Benchmark is applied once in 2017, once in 2019, twice in 2020, and not at all in 2021.

For example, some sources explicitly state that it is evaluated in terms of “Product Quality” [1][9] or “Quality of Method” [2], while others mention evaluation aspects like Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, or even Effectiveness and Performance Efficiency [3][4][5][7][8][10]. However, none of the texts offer an explicit statement tying any one evaluation property uniquely to the Architecture Design Method in the paper “Enabling Continuous Software Engineering for Embedded Systems Architectures with Virtual Prototypes.” In fact, several remarks note that while such evaluation properties are associated with the Architecture Design Method (often via its classification as Classifications₁), there is no clear indication that one particular property (for example, Product Quality or Functional Suitability) is evaluated in that specific paper [10][11][12].

Thus, the final answer is:
“While various evaluation aspects (such as Product Quality, Functional Suitability, Quality in Use, and Effectiveness) have been mentioned in relation to the research object Architecture Design Method in the provided texts, there is no explicit information that ties any single evaluation property to the paper ‘Enabling Continuous Software Engineering for Embedded Systems Architectures with Virtual Prototypes’.”

Thus, according to the information provided, the evaluation method for FLRA is not explicitly described.

For example, in the paper on data management within microservices, the evaluation method explicitly mentioned is Grounded Theory [1] (also confirmed in a related study assessing architecture conformance [3]). In another work—titled “Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events”—the author applied an evaluation approach rooted in Data Science; here the contribution was characterized by evaluation properties such as “Quality in Use” and an emphasis on “Effectiveness” [2].

In addition to these, at least one contribution investigating Architecture Decision Making used a Case Study as its evaluation method [17]. Meanwhile, in a paper titled “A Taxonomy of Blockchain-Based Systems for Architecture Design,” the evaluation was performed using an argumentation approach [18]. 

Thus, the explicitly reported evaluation methods applied by Uwe Zdun in the context of Architecture Decision Making include:  
• Grounded Theory,  
• A Data Science–oriented approach (with attention to quality and effectiveness),  
• A Case Study method, and  
• An argumentation approach. 

Each of these methods is linked to specific contributions as indicated in the relevant sources [1], [2], [3], [17], and [18].

For instance, several papers employ technical experiments in which the contribution is directly evaluated with reference to accuracy [9, 17, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In other cases, a case study is used as the evaluation method, with accuracy identified as one of the measured properties [1, 3, 11, 12, 14, 16, 22, 24, 30]. There are also instances where benchmark methods have been adopted (again with accuracy as an evaluation sub‑property) [27, 29]. Some works indicate the use of controlled experiments and data science techniques to support the evaluation process [2, 6, 23]. In addition, methods such as grounded theory [8, 18] and focus groups [7] have been applied to assess the accuracy of the contributions, even though in these cases accuracy is noted as an evaluation aspect rather than a separately detailed method. Finally, one work even mentions the use of argumentation alongside technical experiments for evaluating accuracy [15].

Thus, across Duc Le’s papers the investigated objects are evaluated in terms of accuracy by applying various methods, including technical experiments, case studies, benchmarks, controlled experiments (and data science approaches), grounded theory, focus groups, and in one instance argumentation. These methods all incorporate the explicit measurement of accuracy as an evaluation sub‑property.

For instance, some contributions were evaluated through a case study (as noted in [1], [15], [23], [25], [27], [30]), while others were assessed via technical experiments (mentioned in [2], [3], [4], [6], [9], [14], [19], [21], [26]). In addition, controlled experiments were applied as evaluation methods in some works (see [5], [7], [11], [18]). Other evaluation methods that appear include the use of interviews ([8], [29]), focus groups ([13], [22]), questionnaires ([22]), benchmarks ([17]), motivating examples ([24]), and even argumentation ([28]). 

Thus, the evaluation of usability in Lu Xiao’s papers has been carried out by:
• Case Studies  
• Technical Experiments  
• Controlled Experiments  
• Interviews  
• Focus Groups and Questionnaires  
• Benchmarks  
• Motivating Examples  
• Argumentation

Each partial answer provides one or more of these methods, reflecting that different papers and contributions by Lu Xiao have used different approaches to evaluate the usability of the investigated objects [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].

• A technical experiment was used in multiple instances to evaluate the research object. This method is explicitly mentioned in [1], [2], [6], [9], [12], and [16].  
• A case study was also applied as an evaluation method. Numerous sources state that the approach is illustrated through a case study (see [3], [4], [5], [8], [13], [14], [17], [20], [22], [25], [27], [28], [29], and [30]).  
• In addition, one description indicates that a motivating example was employed as an evaluation approach (as noted in [7] and [24]).  
• There are also single mentions of other methods: one source describes a controlled experiment ([26]) and another mentions verification ([21]), while one text explicitly states the use of the Grounded Theory method ([19]).  

In summary, Stephan Seifermann’s evaluation of the Architecture Analysis Method involves primarily technical experiments and case studies, with additional approaches (motivating example, controlled experiment, verification, and grounded theory) mentioned in the context of different contributions or related evaluation aspects.

For example, one set of texts explicitly states that in the work “A Platform Architecture for Multi‐Tenant Blockchain‐Based Systems” the evaluation includes a Performance efficiency sub‐property and uses both a Technical Experiment and Argumentation ([18]). Although several other contributions are associated with a single evaluation method (such as Case Study or Technical Experiment), the explicitly stated information that directly links David Monschein to evaluations of Efficiency shows that two different evaluation methods were applied ([18]).

The majority of sources (for example, [1], [2], [8], [9], [11], [13], [14], [17], [19], [20], and [22]) indicate that only one evaluation method was applied—and in many cases that method is identified as a case study. In contrast, a couple of sources present different perspectives: one text ([3]) explicitly states that a Field Experiment was used, and another ([23]) distinguishes between an “evaluation method” and an “architecture analysis method” (suggesting two distinct methods). 

On balance, however, most of the provided evidence points to a single evaluation method—typically the case study—as the method used by Georg Buchgeher to evaluate the property satisfaction.

• Focus Group [1, 6, 10]  
• Technical Experiment [2, 12]  
• Argumentation Approach [3]  
• Interview [4, 9, 15]  
• Case Study [5, 7]  
• Questionnaire [16]  
• Data Science [17, 19]  
• Grounded Theory [14, 21]  
• Benchmark [20]  
• Field Experiment [18]

Most papers mention one explicit evaluation method per study; however, one instance [20] notes that two evaluation methods (Benchmark and Technical Experiment) were applied in the same paper.

Thus, according to the provided texts, Ingo Weber has used a total of 10 distinct evaluation methods in those papers that investigate Architecture Decision Making.

(Note that the partial answers [1]–[29] each report one or more properties evaluated using a technical experiment in papers attributed to Mohamed Soliman or works assumed to be by him. In the final answer each mentioned property is included only once in the overall ranking.)

The union of evaluation properties extracted from the texts is as follows (with the original source IDs in brackets indicating where each property appears):  

• Accuracy [7], [9], [12], [14], [18], [24], [28]  
• Compatibility [8]  
• Effectiveness [3], [11], [15]  
• Efficiency (as reported in [15])  
• Functional Suitability [1], [2], [13], [17], [25], [29]  
• Maintainability [27]  
• Performance efficiency [4], [5], [10], [13], [16], [19], [20], [25], [26], [27], [28]  
• Portability [27]  
• Product Quality [1], [2], [4], [5], [8], [10], [13], [16], [17], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [28], [29]  
• Quality in Use [3], [7], [11], [15]  
• Quality of Method [7], [9], [12], [14], [18], [24], [28]  
• Satisfaction [11], [21]  
• Usability [23]

When these properties are sorted in descending alphabetical order (comparing letter by letter, with properties beginning with later letters coming first), the final ranked list is:

1. Usability  
2. Quality of Method  
3. Quality in Use  
4. Satisfaction  
5. Product Quality  
6. Portability  
7. Performance efficiency  
8. Maintainability  
9. Functional Suitability  
10. Efficiency  
11. Effectiveness  
12. Compatibility  
13. Accuracy

This final answer, which combines and ranks the evaluation properties as reported in the various partial answers ([1] through [29]), fully addresses the question.

• Some sources list only two evaluation properties. One set is “Product Quality” together with “Performance efficiency” ([1]); another set is “Quality of Method” together with “Product Quality” ([2], [9]); and yet another set is “Quality in Use” and “Product Quality” ([7]). In two cases the evaluations include a value “false” ([3], [8]).  
• One text details a set of four items—“Quality in Use”, “Efficiency”, “Effectiveness”, and “Construct Validity” ([4]).  
• Yet other texts indicate that three evaluation properties have been investigated. One pair of texts ([5] and [10]) reports that the Technical Experiment investigated “Product Quality”, “Performance efficiency”, and “Functional Suitability”. When these three are arranged in descending alphabetical order, the order is:
  1. Product Quality  
  2. Performance efficiency  
  3. Functional Suitability

Because the question asks specifically for the evaluation properties investigated (by applying the Technical Experiment) arranged in descending alphabetical order, and given that two sources ([5] and [10]) clearly provide a three–property set, the final answer is:

“Product Quality”, “Performance efficiency”, and “Functional Suitability” (listed in descending alphabetical order).

Note that none of the provided texts explicitly name Andreas Burger as the evaluator, but these are the evaluation properties connected to the Technical Experiment as given in the texts.

• In 2018, there is at least one paper that investigates a research object related to architectural aspects. For example, one contribution (as noted in [1], [2], [5], [6], and [7]) discusses architectural analysis methods or reference architectures with an explicit publication year of 2018.  
 
• In contrast, for 2020 no paper investigating the research object ""Architecture Extraction"" (or its closely related objects) is mentioned in the available texts. In fact, although one paper published in 2020 is described in [4], it addresses a different architectural research object rather than ""Architecture Extraction.""

Thus, the comparison reveals that while architectural topics are investigated in 2018, there is no explicit information on any investigation of ""Architecture Extraction"" for the publication year 2020 [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].

In contrast, although several publications from 2018 mention topics within software architecture and design, none of the texts explicitly state that architecture patterns were investigated in that year (as noted by sources like [1], [4], [9], and others). 

Thus, the publications indicate one investigation in 2020 compared to no explicit investigation in 2018.

Several sources indicate that the Questionnaire evaluation method is associated with a paper published in 2021—with no corresponding instance clearly reported for a paper in 2020 [1], [2], [5], [6]. In one account, the 2021 paper ""Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems"" is noted as using the Questionnaire method, and no paper in 2020 is mentioned [3]. In contrast, another text indicates that the questionnaire was applied in the study ""Determining Microservice Boundaries: A Case Study Using Static and Dynamic Software Analysis"" published in 2020, while not associating it with any 2021 publication [4]. Additionally, one source makes no reference to the Questionnaire evaluation method for either publication year [7].

Thus, one cluster of texts suggests that compared to 2020 (which shows no record of applying the Questionnaire method), there is one instance in 2021. However, an alternative account attributes the use of the Questionnaire method to a 2020 paper instead. Given these discrepancies among the sources, a definitive comparison cannot be reliably made based solely on the provided information.

All the texts refer to a single research object—for example, the contribution labeled “Classifications_1” (which in some instances is described as representing an Architecture Analysis Method or as part of “Architecture Decision Making”). In many descriptions an evaluation method is indeed attached (for instance, a Case Study, a Technical Experiment, or a Questionnaire is reported, as noted in sources [2], [3], [7], [9], [10], [12], [17], [19], [22], [26], and [27]). However, several sources also report explicit evaluation-related properties (such as “Evaluation Guideline,” “Evaluation Property,” or “Evaluation Sub‐Property”) being set to False, or state that no evaluation guideline was applied (sources [4], [5], [8], [13], [14], [15], [16], [21], [23], [25], [27]). One paper – for example, the one dealing with “Architecture Decision Making” – is sometimes described with no evaluation method applied (even though evaluations may be reported in alternate descriptions).

Thus, the only research object that has been investigated repeatedly by Uwe Zdun is the one designated “Classifications_1.” And while in several accounts an explicit evaluation method (such as a Case Study, Technical Experiment, or Questionnaire) is noted, there are also explicit instances (by virtue of the evaluation guideline/property being set to False) indicating that no evaluation method was applied.

In summary, the answer is:

The investigated research object is “Classifications_1” (which in some contexts is associated with Architecture Analysis Method or Architecture Decision Making). Although multiple texts assign evaluation methods to it, there are explicit instances (as indicated by settings such as “Evaluation Guideline: False” and similar false evaluation properties) in which no evaluation method was applied.

For example:

• A Case Study was used in several contributions ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [9], [13], [14], [17], [20], [23], [30]). In these instances the “evaluation guideline” (and when applicable the “Referenced Threats to Validity Guideline”) is explicitly noted as False.

• A Technical Experiment was employed in other contributions, again with no evaluation guideline applied ([7], [12], [19], [22], [25]).

• Other methods mentioned were a Motivating Example ([8], [10]), an Interview ([28]), a Focus Group ([21]), a Data Science evaluation method ([26]), and an argumentation approach ([24]). In each of these cases the texts state that no evaluation guideline was used.

One contribution also reports the use of Grounded Theory ([11], [18]); however, while one description notes that an evaluation guideline may have been applied, other details indicate that—at least with respect to certain properties—no evaluation guideline was used. (In one synthesis, it appears that for Grounded Theory the evaluation guideline was actually applied, so it does not fully meet the “without an evaluation guideline” criterion.)

Thus, to directly answer the question: Muhammad Babar’s work has used Case Studies, Technical Experiments, Motivating Examples, Interviews, Focus Groups, Data Science, and argumentation approaches as evaluation methods—and for each of these the evaluation was performed without an evaluation guideline ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [7], [8], [10], [12], [13], [14], [17], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [28]).

For example, one paper (“Integrating Statistical Response Time Models in Architectural Performance Models”) used a Technical Experiment without a guideline [1], while others clearly employed a Case Study approach without a guideline [2], [3]. In addition to these, other works were evaluated by technical experiments (as seen in “Determination and Enforcement of Least-Privilege Architecture in Android” [11] and “From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach” [12]), as well as by Data Science methods (e.g. in “The Evolution of Technical Debt in the Apache Ecosystem” [29] and “An Empirical Study of Architectural Decay in Open‐Source Software” [30]). Furthermore, evaluation methods such as the Focus Group were used without accompanying guidelines in papers like “Continuous Architecture: Towards the Goldilocks Zone and Away from Vicious Circles” [24] and “On Cognitive Biases in Architecture Decision Making” [28]. Additional examples include the use of Data Science (in “FLRA: A Reference Architecture for Federated Learning Systems” [13] and others) and complex evaluations that combined several aspects (as in “Optimized Dependency Weights in Source Code Clustering,” which incorporated aspects such as a Technical Experiment, quality assessment, and threats to validity without any guiding framework [21]). 

In summary, the evaluation methods applied without a guideline in the papers published by Johannes Grohmann include:
• Technical Experiment  
• Case Study  
• Focus Group  
• Data Science (and related quantitative quality assessments)  

All these methods were applied explicitly without adhering to any evaluation guideline or referencing a Threats to Validity Guideline [1], [2], [3], [11], [12], [13], [21], [24], [25], [27], [28], [29], [30].

In particular, across the different works, this same research object is characterized in various ways depending on the context of the study. For instance, it is described as:

• An Architecture Optimization Method in the context of software architectural refactoring [1].  
• An Architecture Design Method (or, in one case, as two distinct methods—Architecture Design Method and Architecture Analysis Method) [8, 16, 23].  
• A Reference Architecture (or as an Architecture Description in certain studies) [5, 6, 20, 28].  
• An Architecture Description Language or other attributes such as Architectural Aspects or Architectural Decision Making [9, 11, 22, 25].  

In every instance, the texts explicitly note that although the research object “uses input data” in its description, in fact no input data was used during the investigation. Thus, regardless of the precise categorization (whether it is an optimization method, design method, analysis method, or description language), the common feature is that the investigated research object—always identified as Classifications_1—has been employed without any input data [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].

Some sources highlight the evaluation of effectiveness as a key focus [1, 5, 8], while others point to properties such as Quality in Use [2, 6], accuracy [3, 12, 15, 17], performance efficiency [4, 7, 16], and Product Quality or Functional Suitability [9, 10, 22, 27]. In some cases, the evaluation is even noted as being “False” [11, 28] or associated with other properties (such as Compatibility [29]).  

Because the texts do not provide frequency counts or an explicit comparative statement across multiple papers, there is no unequivocal single property that stands out as being evaluated most often. In summary, Romina Eramo’s papers in this area are evaluated using a range of properties—with multiple instances mentioning effectiveness, quality aspects (Quality in Use or Product Quality), and accuracy—so no single evaluation property can be identified as dominant based solely on the provided information.

Several texts explicitly report that a case study was used in contributions with those characteristics [1], [5], [6], [25], [26]. 

It is worth noting that other evaluation methods—such as Technical Experiment—are mentioned in some instances [2], [3], [9], [11], [16], [27]. However, when the research object is clearly identified as Architecture Extraction along with the paper class Proposal of Solution, the only evaluation method explicitly connected to that combination is the Case Study [1], [5], [6], [25], [26].

Thus, while Technical Experiment and even other approaches (e.g., Benchmark or Data Science) are noted elsewhere in the texts, the most clearly and frequently applied evaluation method in the context of a Proposal of Solution addressing Architecture Extraction is the Case Study.

For example, one source states that the paper “Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization” used a case study as its evaluation method and concludes that therefore the case study is the most applied method [2]. This observation is reinforced by other sources, such as one describing “IAS: An IoT Architectural Self-adaptation Framework” [3] and another referring to “Case Study” as the explicit evaluation method for a Classifications_1 contribution [5]. Additional texts [8], [12], [18], [22], [27], and [30] also explicitly identify and use the case study evaluation method in their evaluations.

Some sources mention alternative methods (for example, Technical Experiment, Argumentation, Grounded Theory, Controlled Experiment, and Focus Group), but multiple independent references explicitly stating the application of case studies lead to the conclusion that the case study has been applied most frequently according to the provided 2020 papers [2], [3], [5], [8], [10], [12], [18], [22], [27], [30].

• One source ([1]) reports that a 2019 paper (“Architectural Security Weaknesses in Industrial Control Systems…”) was evaluated using Data Science and indicates no further occurrences in 2020 or 2021.  
• In contrast, two sources ([3] and [5]) indicate that a paper evaluated using Data Science was published in 2021 (with no such papers for 2019 or 2020).  
• Several other sources ([2], [4], [7], [8]) state that there is no evidence of any paper, from 2019 through 2021, being evaluated with Data Science.  
• One source ([6]) acknowledges a 2021 publication but notes its evaluation property for Data Science is effectively False.

In summary, across the texts there is inconsistent evidence. Some sources suggest a single instance using Data Science—either in 2019 ([1]) or in 2021 ([3] and [5])—while several other sources report no instances in that period. Thus, depending on which partial answer is accepted, the frequency per publication year from 2019 to 2021 is either:

 • 2019: 1 paper, 2020: 0 papers, 2021: 0 papers (per [1])  
  or  
 • 2019: 0 papers, 2020: 0 papers, 2021: 1 paper (per [3] and [5])  
  or even  
 • 0 papers across all three years (per [2], [4], [7], [8]).

This synthesis shows that the provided texts do not offer a consistent answer about which exact year featured a Data Science evaluation, but they generally agree that if any instance exists, it is limited to a single paper in one of these three years with no evaluations in the remaining years.

One text [1] indicates that the work “Architectural Patterns for Cross-Domain Personalised Automotive Functions” was published in 2020 and evaluates a research object (Classifications_1) using Argumentation. However, several other texts [2], [3], [4], [5], and [6] consistently report that either the only research object associated with Argumentation was published earlier (in 2017) or that no research object in the period 2019–2021 was evaluated using Argumentation. In particular, [2]–[5] clarify that the research object evaluated by Argumentation is not linked to any publication within the specified period, and [6] confirms that the sole research object from 2019 does not use Argumentation.

In summary, while one source [1] mentions a 2020 publication using Argumentation, the preponderance of evidence from [2] to [6] indicates that no research objects evaluated with the Argumentation method fall within the publication years 2019 to 2021.

• In 2017 several publications are reported to have evaluated compatibility. The applied methods vary among different studies and include approaches such as a motivating example (which appears both as a stand‐alone evaluation method and as an aspect of a broader argumentation‐based approach), case studies, focus groups, and even an argumentation approach (see [2], [3], [4], [5], [10], [16], [18]).  

• In 2018 there are also publications evaluating compatibility. In these studies the evaluation methods include case studies as well as technical experiments. In addition, one publication shows a multifaceted approach that incorporates a motivating example together with a series of evaluation aspects (for instance, specifying evaluation properties like “Product Quality” and sub‐properties such as “Functional Suitability”) along with additional details (such as the absence of evaluation guidelines and the use of tool support) (see [7], [8], [13], [19]).  

• In 2019, the texts point to several publications with explicit evaluation details. These works applied methods such as case studies, focus groups, and even grounded theory. Other aspects mentioned in the evaluation reports include the quality of method assessment, accuracy measurement, and further classification as evaluation research (see [9], [11], [12], [14], [15], [17]).  

Thus, over the period 2017–2019 the applied evaluation methods for assessing compatibility are not uniform but rather distributed as follows: publications from 2017 have applied methods including motivating example, case study, argumentation, and focus groups; those from 2018 have used case studies, technical experiments, and multifaceted approaches that cover several evaluation facets; and publications from 2019 have mainly relied on case studies, focus groups, and grounded theory together with other complementary evaluation details.

• [8] The paper “Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multi-level Greedy Modularity Clustering for Software Architecture Recovery” is described as exploring architectural assumptions in detail.

• [16] The paper “Improving the Consistency and Usefulness of Architecture Descriptions: Guidelines for Architects” explicitly includes a research object that represents Architectural Assumptions.

In addition, while not using the exact phrase “architectural assumptions,” a few other works are associated with investigation of architectural topics. For example, [12] (“Testing the Implementation of Concurrent AUTOSAR Drivers Against Architecture Decisions”) directly addresses architectural decisions (a subject closely related to architectural assumptions), and [2] (“Safety Analysis Method for Cooperative Driving Systems”) is linked with the Architecture Analysis Method, suggesting its involvement in architectural investigations.

However, if one is to identify those papers that most explicitly investigate architectural assumptions, only [8] and [16] meet that criterion.

• According to [1], ""Continuous Experimentation for Automotive Software on the Example of a Heavy Commercial Vehicle in Daily Operation"" explicitly applied the evaluation method Argumentation.

• According to [6], ""Unlimited Rulebook: a Reference Architecture for Economy Mechanics in Digital Games"" is explicitly linked to the evaluation method Argumentation (as noted in one of its descriptions).

There is one additional case:
• [5] reports that ""Architectural Patterns for Cross-Domain Personalised Automotive Functions"" has conflicting information—one text indicates that its contribution employs Argumentation, while another associates it with a Technical Experiment. Consequently, its use of Argumentation remains ambiguous.

All other reviewed texts indicate that papers published in 2020 applied evaluation methods other than Argumentation.

• Some sources indicate that there is one paper published in 2020 with this focus (as noted in [2], [3], [7], and [13]), while they report no such paper in 2021.  
• In contrast, other sources indicate that at least one paper published in 2021 is investigating Architecture Evolution (as noted in [4], [5], [11], and [12]), with no paper identified for 2020.  
• Additional sources ([1], [6], [8], [9], and [10]) either do not provide any clear evidence about a paper for one or both years or explicitly mention that no paper on Architecture Evolution is identified in the respective year.

Thus, the available texts present two different scenarios: one scenario reporting 1 paper in 2020 versus 0 in 2021, and another scenario reporting 0 in 2020 versus 1 in 2021.

• Partial answers [1], [2], [3], and [5] indicate that one paper evaluating Maintainability was published in 2020 and that no paper from 2017 is reported to evaluate Maintainability.

• In contrast, partial answers [4] and [6] state that one paper from 2017 does evaluate Maintainability and that there is no corresponding paper from 2020.

• Additionally, partial answer [7] mentions a 2017 paper but does not explicitly attribute an evaluation of Maintainability to it, nor does it provide evidence of any such evaluation for a 2020 paper.

Thus, based solely on the provided texts, the information is contradictory: some sources claim that Maintainability is evaluated by a 2020 paper while others indicate that it is evaluated by a 2017 paper. No unified answer can be determined without further clarification.

Some texts ([2], [5], and [6]) claim that certain 2017 papers – for example, “Microservice Ambients: An Architectural Meta-Modelling Approach for Microservice Granularity,” “Continuous Integration Impediments in Large-Scale Industry Projects,” and “Design Criteria to Architect Continuous Experimentation for Self-Driving Vehicles” – investigate the research object Architecture Design Method and report that no input data was used. In contrast, many other texts ([1], [9]–[11], [13]–[18], [20]–[24]) and their subsequent analyses conclude that none of the papers published in 2017 meet all three criteria simultaneously (being published in 2017, investigating Architecture Design Method, and not having used input data).

Thus, based solely on the provided partial answers, there is no unequivocal consensus and the preponderance of the later texts ([9], [10], [11], [13]–[18], [20]–[24]) indicates that no paper published in 2017 both investigates the research object Architecture Design Method and has not used input data.

For example:

• [1] The work “Recovering Architectural Design Decisions” is explained as contributing to architecture decision making, and its classification notes that the input data was used but is not available. It was published in 2018.

• [2] “Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events: A Qualitative Multi-method Study” is also described as addressing architecture decision making and, according to the evidence, its input data is not available—while it was published in 2018.

• [3] “Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context” is noted as explicitly linked to architecture decision making and is reported to have a contribution whose input data is not available, with publication in 2018.

• [14] “Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision-Making in an Agile Context” explicitly investigates architecture decision making. It also explicitly notes that no input data was used, and it was published in 2018.

• [22] “Using Informal Knowledge for Improving Software Quality Trade‐Off Decisions” is mentioned as a paper in the Software Architecture and Design field (thus related to architecture decision making) and it explicitly states that, although it indicates the use of input data, no input data was actually used. It, too, was published in 2018.

Thus, according to texts [1], [2], [3], [14], and [22], these five papers meet the conditions of investigating architecture decision making and not having available input data in 2018.

On one hand, two partial answers state that specific papers could meet the criteria. According to [1], the paper ""On Cognitive Biases in Architecture Decision Making"" is published in 2017, uses a Focus Group evaluation method, and does not use input data. Similarly, [2] claims that ""Architectural Assumptions and Their Management in Industry – An Exploratory Study"" meets the criteria by being published in 2017, using a Focus Group for evaluation, and not having input data. 

On the other hand, several other texts ([3], [4], [5], and [6]) indicate that no paper satisfies all three conditions simultaneously (evaluation using a Focus Group, no input data used, and publication in 2017). For example, [3] points out that a 2017 paper has a Case Study (not a Focus Group) evaluation and uses input data, while [5] and [6] mention papers with a Focus Group evaluation that were published in years other than 2017 and/or used input data.

Thus, based on the provided descriptions, there is an inconsistency in the information. Although [1] and [2] suggest potential candidates, the other texts lead to the conclusion that no paper in the provided data simultaneously meets all the conditions of having used a Focus Group evaluation method, not using input data, and being published in 2017. 

In summary, the combined analysis of the texts results in the conclusion that there is no paper meeting all of the specified criteria [1][2][3][4][5][6].

• A second paper was published in 2018; its evaluation is exemplified via a case study (which counts as a motivating example), and its contribution is noted as “No input data used” [4].

• A third paper is noted as being from 2018, uses a motivating example as part of its evaluation, and its contribution is also defined by “No input data used” [11].

One source [1] clearly indicates that the work “Formal Software Architectural Migration Towards Emerging Architectural Styles” applies Benchmark in 2020 and is classified as a “Proposal of Solution.” On the other hand, another source [2] explains that the paper “Employment of Optimal Approximations on Apache Hadoop Checkpoint Technique for Performance Improvements” is evaluated using Benchmark and is described with two different labels—“Validation Research” and “Proposal of Solution”—with no indication that one label appears more frequently than the other.

Considering the information, one interpretation is that if the paper in [1] is taken as representative and only one paper class appears in that instance, then “Proposal of Solution” emerges as the most frequent paper class. However, it is also noted that the conflicting labels in [2] create ambiguity regarding a completely definitive answer. 

Given the data provided by the texts, the most supported conclusion is that the most frequent paper class among those papers from 2020 that apply the Benchmark evaluation method is “Proposal of Solution” [1].

• Partial answer [3] identifies “Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution” as the only paper explicitly stated to be both from 2021 and associated with Architecture Evolution. It is classified as Evaluation Research.

• Partial answer [6] discusses “Continuous API Evolution in Heterogenous Enterprise Software Systems” (a 2021 paper associated with Architecture Evolution) that is given conflicting classifications. One passage indicates its associated contribution (Classifications_1) is a Proposal of Solution while another indicates Evaluation Research. Although the texts do not resolve the conflict, one of the references (in [3]) clearly assigns Evaluation Research.

Given that Evaluation Research is clearly cited for one paper and also mentioned (as one alternative) for the other, there is a slight tendency for Evaluation Research to appear in relation to the 2021 papers with Architecture Evolution. Therefore, based on the available information, the most frequent paper class for papers with the research object Architecture Evolution published in 2021 appears to be Evaluation Research [3][6].

However, when tallying the explicit classifications, Evaluation Research is mentioned in more instances (for example, in texts [1], [6], [9], [11], [12], [13], [15], [20], [23], [24], [25], and [26]) than the other labels. Although some works are also described as Validation Research or as a Proposal of Solution, the preponderance of explicit classifications falls under Evaluation Research. 

Thus, according to the available partial answers, the most frequent paper class for 2018, in the context of investigating architecture extractions, is Evaluation Research [1], [6], [9], [11], [12], [13], [15], [20], [23], [24], [25], [26].

For example, one paper that explicitly investigates Architecture Extraction was published in 2018 ([1], [2], [7]), whereas another explicitly identified work on Architecture Extraction was published in 2020 ([8]). Several other texts mention works from years outside the 2018–2020 range or associate with related topics but do not provide clear evidence of Architecture Extraction research in the target years. Thus, the available evidence indicates that at least one paper from 2018 and one from 2020 investigated Architecture Extraction.

In one group of partial answers ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [17], [21], [22], [25], [26], [28]), the only paper mentioned is published in 2018 and no papers are reported for 2019 or 2020.

Thus, according to the provided texts:
• In some instances, the distribution shows one paper from 2018 and none from 2019 or 2020.
• In other instances, the distribution shows one paper from 2020 and none from 2018 or 2019.

In all cases, no publication from 2019 is mentioned, and each set of texts identifies only a single paper within the 2018–2020 interval. This discrepancy suggests that, based solely on the provided information, there is evidence for a single relevant paper in the period, but its publication year differs between sources, being either 2018 or 2020.
