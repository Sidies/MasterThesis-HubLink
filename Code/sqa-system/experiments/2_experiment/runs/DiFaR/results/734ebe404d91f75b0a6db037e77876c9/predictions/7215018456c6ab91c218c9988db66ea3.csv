1. **Enabling Consistency between Software Artefacts for Software Adaption and Evolution** (2021) - This study focuses on ensuring consistency among software artifacts, which is crucial for compatibility in software adaptation and evolution.
   
2. **Architectural Concerns for Digital Twin of the Organization** (2020) - This study addresses architectural concerns that can impact compatibility in the context of digital twins.

3. **Assessing Architecture Conformance to Coupling-Related Patterns and Practices in Microservices** (2020) - This study evaluates how well architectures conform to established patterns and practices, which relates to compatibility.

4. **Testing the Implementation of Concurrent AUTOSAR Drivers Against Architecture Decisions** (2019) - This study assesses the compatibility of implementations with architectural decisions.

5. **Understanding Architecture Decisions in Context** (2018) - This study explores how architecture decisions are made in context, which can influence compatibility.

6. **Continuous Architecture: Towards the Goldilocks Zone and Away from Vicious Circles** (2019) - This study discusses architectural practices that can affect compatibility.
