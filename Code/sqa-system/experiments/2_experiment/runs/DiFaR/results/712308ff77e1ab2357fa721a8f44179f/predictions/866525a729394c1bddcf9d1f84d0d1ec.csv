5. ""An Architecture for Decentralized, Collaborative, and Autonomous Robots"" (2018)
6. ""Data-Centric Communication and Containerization for Future Automotive Software Architectures"" (2018)

This totals to 6 evaluations of Maintainability through Case Studies.

The property Usability is evaluated in the context of Case Studies in the following instances:

1. ""Continuous Integration Impediments in Large-Scale Industry Projects"" (2017)
2. ""Mapping Features to Source Code through Product Line Architecture: Traceability and Conformance"" (2017)
3. ""DesignDiff: Continuously Modeling Software Design Difference from Code Revisions"" (2020)
