In “A Blockchain‐Based Micro Economy Platform for Distributed Infrastructure Initiatives”, the evaluation method is embedded in a context where distributed infrastructure and blockchain application require a qualitative or mixed‐method analysis based on predefined evaluation criteria, likely emphasizing aspects such as trust, decentralization, and system integrity. In contrast, “Integrating Statistical Response Time Models in Architectural Performance Models” applies an evaluation method that leans toward quantitative analysis, integrating statistical response time models to evaluate and predict architectural performance. In summary, while both papers leverage a common evaluation framework (as evidenced by their connection to the Evaluation Method List and Evaluation Method Entity), the former evaluates a distributed blockchain system with a focus on economic and infrastructural factors, whereas the latter focuses on statistical performance metrics within architectural models.","['(R870801:Evaluation Method List,

However, the specific names or details of the evaluation methods applied (for example, a checklist, a set of measurements, experiments, “case study” or simulation‐based methods) are not explicitly provided in the converted evidences. In short, the author appears to have relied on a structured evaluation via an “Evaluation Method List” (i.e. an evaluation method entity) linked to the Architecture Analysis Method, but the precise evaluation methods (e.g. detailed techniques or criteria) cannot be determined from the provided context.","['(R871640:Evaluation Method List, Entity, R871641:Evaluation Method Entity)',

In 2019, one research object – for example, the one related to “Aspect‐Oriented Modeling of Technology Heterogeneity in Microservice Architecture” (as indicated by its publication year in the neighbor evidence) – is evaluated using Grounded Theory. In contrast, in 2021 several research objects – for instance “Dynamic Updates of Virtual PLCs Deployed as Kubernetes Microservices” – are evaluated with Grounded Theory. Overall, the evidence suggests that while a grounded‐theory evaluation is present both in 2019 and 2021, the 2021 “batch” (including the Dynamic Updates study and likely others connected by similar contribution and evaluation links) is more dominant.","['(R868576:Research Object, evaluation, R868577:Evaluation)', '(R868572:Classifications_2, Research Object, R868576:Research Object)',
