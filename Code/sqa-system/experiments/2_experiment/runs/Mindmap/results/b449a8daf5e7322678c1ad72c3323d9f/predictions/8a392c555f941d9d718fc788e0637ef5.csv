Thus, within the provided evidence the only distinct publication year mentioned is 2018 for one paper, while the rest lack a year context. In summary, the distribution is as follows:

One paper – “A Flexible Architecture for Key Performance Indicators Assessment in Smart Cities” – shows an explicit publication year (2020), so at least for 2020 there is one paper in that class. In addition, “An Expert Recommendation System for Design Decision Making: Who Should be Involved in Making a Design Decision?” is also connected in a similar fashion.

In particular, the paper “A Flexible Architecture for Key Performance Indicators Assessment in Smart Cities” (linked via its publication year “2020”) is connected to evaluation research (via the “Classifications_1” node) that uses (at least) one evaluation approach – for example, via the evaluation method “Technical Experiment.” Hence, for year 2020 it appears that one evaluation approach has been applied in a paper published by Danny Weyns. For other years, the provided context does not include a clear mapping of publication year to evaluation approach count.

In particular, evaluation sub-properties—including usability—and related quality aspects (e.g. aspects under “Quality of Method” such as accuracy, effectiveness, and functional suitability) are used to assess the objects.
