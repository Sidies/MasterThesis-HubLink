In the related neighbor‐based evidence, the Property entity is associated with “Quality in Use” (Neighbor-based Evidence 2) and is also connected via “Sub-Property” (Neighbor-based Evidence 1). Therefore, interpreting the evidence, we consider that the evaluated properties are the Property itself (as a general evaluation target) and its “Quality in Use” aspect. When ranking these in descending alphabetical order, “Quality in Use” comes before “Property”.

Since the only publication with a clear publication‐year context in the provided evidence is “Empirical Insights into the Evolving Role of Architects in Decision‐Making in an Agile Context” (with publication year 2018) – and António Silva is not connected with that paper – the single paper in which António Silva is evidenced (“A Complexity Metric for Microservices Architecture Migration”) does not have an explicitly provided publication year. In consequence, we can only conclude that in the one publication where António Silva appears with a research object the investigation involved 1 research object.

Based on the provided context, the evaluation methods applied in papers that evaluate compatibility are those structured by the “Evaluation Method List” – that is, methods identified as “Evaluation Method Entity” that are used in the evaluation process. In other words, the papers obtain their evaluation methods by (a) linking an evaluation—through its “Evaluation method” relationship—to a list that organizes the evaluation methods (i.e. the “Evaluation Method List”), and (b) by analysing the properties tied to compatibility (via the “Property” entity having “Name” equal to Compatibility). Thus, the evaluation of compatibility is carried out by applying the evaluation methods recorded in that list; that is, property‐driven and procedure‐based evaluation methods as defined by the “Evaluation Method Entity.”

Two publications are indirectly associated with “Architectural Assumptions”: “Mapping Features to Source Code through Product Line Architecture: Traceability and Conformance” and “Predicting the Performance of Privacy-Preserving Data Analytics Using Architecture Modelling and Simulation”. However, explicit publication year information is only available for the publication “Data Stream Operations as First-Class Entities in Component-Based Performance Models” (year 2020), which is not part of the chain leading to “Architectural Assumptions”. Hence, with the current evidence no clear distribution per year can be derived for the publications investigating “Architectural Assumptions”. In other words, the context does not contain a complete set of publication years for those works; therefore one cannot yet report a year‐by‐year distribution.

 • A qualitative multi‐method study approach (as evidenced by the study titled “Architectural Design Decisions for Systems Supporting Model-Based Analysis of Runtime Events: A Qualitative Multi-method Study”)
 • An evaluation approach that employs optimal approximations on Apache Hadoop checkpoint techniques (as evidenced by the publication “Employment of Optimal Approximations on Apache Hadoop Checkpoint Technique for Performance Improvements”)

In other words, the papers publish evaluation results in which research objects (e.g. software artifacts) are assessed by means of a quality‐informed evaluation method that explicitly considers usability as one of its dimensions. This evaluation process appears to involve linking the “Evaluation” entity—with its associated “Property” entities named “Usability” and “Quality of Method”—to research objects, which indicates that the evaluation approach hinges on assessing the usability of an object by measuring it against predetermined quality criteria.","['(R871467:Property, Name, L1526475:Quality of Method)',
