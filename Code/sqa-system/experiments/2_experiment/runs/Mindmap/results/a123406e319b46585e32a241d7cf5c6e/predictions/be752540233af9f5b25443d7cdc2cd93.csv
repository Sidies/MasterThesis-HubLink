In contrast, “Integrating Statistical Response Time Models in Architectural Performance Models” employs an analytical evaluation method where statistical models are combined with architectural performance models—indicating a more model‐driven, simulation‐oriented approach. Thus, while the first paper emphasizes practical empirical validation in a distributed infrastructure context, the second paper focuses on integrating quantitative statistical measures into performance modeling for software architectures.","['(R872267:Paper Class 1, paper class, L1528135:Evaluation Research)', '(R872233:Understanding Software Vulnerabilities Related to Architectural

 • “Identifying Domain-Based Cyclic Dependencies in Microservice APIs Using Source Code Detectors” (Path‐based Evidence 5) and 
 • “Evaluating the Effectiveness of Multi-level Greedy Modularity Clustering for Software Architecture Recovery” (Path‐based Evidence 8). 

However, none of the available evidence associates a publication year (2018 or 2020) directly with these publications. Although some other papers are indicated with publication years (e.g. Evidence 12 points to a paper in 2018; Evidence 14 and 16 point to papers in 2020), none of those papers are directly connected (through a “research object” relationship) to “Architecture Extraction.” 

Thus, from the provided context the answer is that no paper investigating the research object “Architecture Extraction” can be clearly assigned to 2018 or 2020 – the two papers linked to “Architecture Extraction” do not have a specified publication year in the evidence.
