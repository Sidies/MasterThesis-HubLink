    "### QA Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the Question-Answering (QA) Dataset for the annotation data [merged_ecsa_icsa.json](../../../../data/external/merged_ecsa_icsa.json) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation was guided by a matrix consisting of two dimensions:\n",
    "1. **Use Case**\n",
    "    - **1**: The first use case reflects the current state-of-practice in scientific literature search. The researcher seeks additional details about the metadata of one or more papers. To find this information, the researcher provides the QA system with specific metadata information related to the papers he is interested in. In response, the QA system returns information on other metadata attributes of the papers rather than content information.\n",
    "    - **2**: In the second use case, the researcher seeks information about the content of one or more papers. In this use case, the researcher provides the QA system with metadata information about the papers and asks a question about their contents. The QA system is then expected to extract content information related to specific papers that conform to the metadata constraints provided.\n",
    "    - **3**: In the third use case, the researcher seeks information about metadata of one or more papers. In this use case, the researcher provides the QA system with content constraints about the papers and asks a question about the metadata of the paper. The QA system is then expected to extract metadata information related to the specific papers mentioned in the question.\n",
    "    - **4**: In the fourth use case, the researcher seeks information about the content of one or more papers. In this use case, the researcher provides the QA system with content information about the paper, and asks a question about the content of the paper. The QA system is then expected to extract content information related to the specific papers mentioned in the question.\n",
    "    - **5**: In the fifth use case, a researcher seeks information about the content of one or more papers. In this use case, the researcher provides the retriever with both metadata and content information about the papers and asks a question about the content of the paper. The retriever is then expected to extract content information related to the specific papers mentioned in the question.\n",
    "    - **6**: In the sixth use case, the researcher seeks information about metadata of one or more papers. In this specific use case, the researcher provides the retriever with both metadata and content information about the papers, such as the name of an evaluation method and the year of publication, and asks a question about the metadata of the papers. The retriever is then expected to extract metadata information related to the specific papers mentioned in the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval Operation Classification**\n",
    "    - **Basic**: Classifies those questions where the retriever is required to just find one ore more facts in the Knowledge Graph and use those to provide the answer without further processing.\n",
    "    - **Aggregation**: Classifies those questions where the retriever is required to quantitatively or qualitatively aggregate the information in the Knowledge Graph to answer the question.\n",
    "    - **Comparative**: Classifies those questions where the retriever is required to compare two or more pieces of information in the Knowledge Graph to answer the question.\n",
    "    - **Ranking**: Classifies those questions where the retriever is required to rank the information in the Knowledge Graph to answer the question.\n",
    "    - **Counting**: Classifies those questions where the retriever is required to count the number of occurrences of a certain information in the Knowledge Graph to answer the question.\n",
    "    - **Superlative**: Classifies those questions where the retriever is required to identify the most or least of a certain information in the Knowledge Graph to answer the question.\n",
    "    - **Relationship**: Classifies questions where the retriever must identify any type of interconnection or reliance between pieces of information in the Knowledge Graph. Essentially, it captures all scenarios where one piece of data is influenced by, contingent upon, or systematically linked to another.\n",
    "    - **Negation**: Classifies those questions where the retriever is required to negate the information in the Knowledge Graph to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Read this File\n",
    "\n",
    "For each prepared question template (see [here](../templates.md)) we prepare the parameters for the clustering or subgraph construction strategies below. From each of the generated questions, we then selected those questions that we considered to already have a high quality and include no hallucination while conforming to the indended template, use case, and retrieval operation."

Considering that the first paper uses two classifications for its paper class, it can be interpreted that the paper classes 'proposal of solution' and 'validation research' are more commonly used within this set of publications when the evaluation method is Data Science and the research object is Architecture Decision Making.\",\"['10.1109/ICSA.2018.00018', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00018', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00018', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00018', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00021', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00021', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00021']\",,\"['(R873908:Evaluation Method Entity, Name, L1531495:Data Science)', '(R873912:Research Object Entity, Name, L1531499:Architecture Decision Making)', '(R873913:Paper Class, proposal of solution, L1531502:True)', '(R873913:Paper Class, validation research, L1531500:True)', '(R873087:Evaluation Method Entity, Name, L1529805:Data Science)', '(R873091:Research Object Entity, Name, L1529809:Architecture Decision Making)', '(R873092:Paper Class, philosophical paper, L1529814:True)']\",clustering_strategy,R659055,Software Architecture and Design,7,Which is the most used paper class for publications with the evaluation method [method name] and the research object [resarch object name]?\n",

This pattern is consistent across multiple studies, indicating that satisfaction is a key metric in assessing the effectiveness of architecture design methods.\",\"['10.1007/978-3-030-58923-3_21', '10.1007/978-3-030-58923-3_21', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00016', '10.1109/ICSA.2018.00016', '10.1007/978-3-030-29983-5_13', '10.1007/978-3-030-29983-5_13', '10.1109/ICSA47634.2020.00016', '10.1109/ICSA47634.2020.00016', '10.1109/ICSA.2017.45', '10.1109/ICSA.2017.45']\",,\"['(R870451:Research Object Entity, Name, L1524378:Architecture Design Method)', '(R870448:Property, Name, L1524375:Satisfaction)', '(R872663:Research Object Entity, Name, L1528942:Architecture Design Method)', '(R872660:Property, Name, L1528939:Satisfaction)', '(R873829:Research Object Entity, Name, L1531318:Architecture Design Method)', '(R873826:Property, Name, L1531315:Satisfaction)', '(R870901:Research Object Entity, Name, L1525331:Architecture Design Method)', '(R870897:Property, Name, L1525327:Satisfaction)', '(R872843:Research Object Entity, Name, L1529313:Architecture Design Method)', '(R872835:Property, Name, L1529306:Satisfaction)']\",clustering_strategy,R659055,Software Architecture and Design,7,How often is the sub-property [sub-property name] used in comparison to the sub-property [sub-property] with the research object [research object name]?\n",
