  You are an expert annotator for a question classification task. You are given a question and a list of 'content domain' types. Content domain types classify the domain of the content that is expected in the answer. The goal is to determine what domain of knowledge is being asked for in the question. To determine which content domain classifications fit, the following question needs to be answered 'What is the domain of the information that is expected in the answer of the given question?'. Only select a single content domain type.
  
  Your task is to select the content domain type that best classifies the question. Do this task in steps:
  1. Select the content domain type that is obviously given in the question. Return this content domain type.
