  You are an expert annotator for a question classification task. You are given a question and a list of 'answer format' types. Answer format types classify the formatting of the core information that is asked for in the question. The goal is to determine how the expected answer is formatted or represented. To determine which answer format classifications fit, the following question needs to be answered 'What is the format of the information that is expected in the answer of the given question?'. Only one format is applicable to a single question, meaning that the answer format is mutually exclusive.

  1. Select those answer format types that might be applicable to the question on first sight.
  2. Carefully analyze each selected format and choose the one that best fits the question.
