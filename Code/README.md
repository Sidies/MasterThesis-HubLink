# About the Project

With the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to academic search a potential emerged to reduce barriers to accessing information and speed up literature research tasks. However, LLMs face substantial limitations when faced with complex knowledge tasks that require deep and responsible reasoning. To solve this issue, Knowledge Graph Question Answering approaches intend to enrich the LLM with external information from a Knowledge Graph (KG) without retraining. But the application of KGQA approaches in the scholarly domain is still an underdeveloped area. We argue, that the application of LLMs can help researchers to find relevant information in a KG to speed up their research process and to improve the quality of their research. In our thesis, we propose HubLink, a novel approach that uses an LLM to reason on subgraphs without needing additional training or fine-tuning. It uses Hubs, which are special concepts utilized in the retrieval approach that hold particular significance for a specific domain or question. Hubs consolidate information and serve as pivotal points when searching for relevant data. To enrich answers with further information and ensure transparency, Hubs are additionally linked to source information. 

To evaluate the effectiveness of the HubLink approach, we apply the retriever on the ORKG by applying it on the approach idea of [Kaplan et al. (2024)](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000171637) called KARAGEN. This approach idea is designed to enhance and ease knowledge access in software architecture research by combining the strengths of KGs and LLMs. It involves generating and populating the ORKG with the help of LLM-based classification and retrieving knowledge by processing user queries through an LLM, querying the ORKG for relevant data, and enhancing it further with LLMs for tasks like summarization and classification. 

To realize this implementation, we developed the Scholarly Question Answering (SQA) system, a modular and flexible system that allows the user to configure and run experiments with different LLMs, datasets, pipelines, pipes, and knowledge bases. The SQA system provides the following capabilities:

1.  **Flexible Configuration Management:** Utilizes easily modifiable JSON-based configuration files to define and serialize parameters for all system components. This ensures straightforward reproducibility and systematic modification of experiments.
2.  **Experiment Execution and Evaluation:** Automates the process of conducting experiments using pipelines defined in configuration files. It evaluates performance using a suite of relevant metrics (e.g., retrieval recall, answer relevance, factuality), stores detailed outcomes along with reproducibility information, and facilitates results visualization through generated diagrams for easier analysis.
3.  **Data Ingestion:** Provides modules for loading publication data and QA pairs from standard JSON and CSV formats, serving as the foundation for knowledge base creation and evaluation datasets.
4.  **Modular RAG Pipeline:** Implements a fully customizable RAG pipeline architecture comprising pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation stages. This modularity allows easy interchanging, configuration, and testing of different algorithms or models at each stage of the workflow.
5.  **Scientific Text Extraction:** Integrates functionality to extract structured information from the text of publications by leveraging an LLM.
6.  **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Supports the modular construction and integration of diverse KGs by providing a unified interface.
7.  **Semi-Automated KGQA Pair Generation:** Incorporates strategies such as graph clustering and subgraph extraction to assist in the generation of relevant QA pairs directly from the underlying KGs.
8.  **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Offers a CLI application for managing configuration files, triggering data ingestion, executing individual experiments, and conducting interactive QA sessions.

The architecture for the SQA system can be seen in the figure below and the code for the SQA system is provided in this repository.

# Installation
This will walk you through the steps required to install and set up the project with a `pyproject.toml` configuration.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.10 - 3.13 for use. **Note:** Because the current version of [Microsoft GraphRag](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/get_started/) requires a Python version equal to or below 3.12, we recommend using Python 3.12 if you intend to work with Microsoft GraphRag. However, you can still run the code with Python 3.13 if you do not intend to work with Microsoft GraphRag as it is an optional dependency. 


### Prerequisites: Install and Initialize Git LFS
Large files are stored in Git LFS. If you don't have Git LFS installed, follow the installation instruction [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) to install it

After installing Git LFS, initialize it by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
git lfs install
```

### Cloning the project repository
With an open terminal, clone the project’s repository by executing the following command:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/software-engineering-meta-research/ak-theses/mastertheses/ma-marco-schneider/implementation.git
```

Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd implementation
```

Then, pull the large files managed by Git LFS:

```bash
git lfs pull
``` 

### (optional but recommended) Create virtual environment
You can optionally choose to run the project in a virtual environment. It is strongly recommended doing this if you have multiple python projects that you would like to run on your device. This short guide will show you how to get a virtual python environment running with pythons `venv` module.

1. Navigate your terminal into the `sqa-system` folder (where pyproject.toml is located).

```bash
cd sqa-system
```

2. Create the virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Now a new folder has been created in the projects root directory that includes the necessary files for the virtual environment. The folder should be called `venv`. After the preparation for the environment is done, the environment needs to be activated.

3. Activate the virtual environment.

**Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```	

Your terminal should now show a `(venv)` next to the path. If that is the case the virtual environment has been activated. If you encounter a terminal permission error take a look at [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56199111/visual-studio-code-cmd-error-cannot-be-loaded-because-running-scripts-is-disabl) or use CMD instead of powershell.

### Installing the Requirements
This project uses a `pyproject.toml` file to manage its dependencies, you can install everything with a single pip command. Make sure your terminal is located in the `sqa-system` directory (where pyproject.toml is located). Execute either of the following commands. It should now proceed to download and install all dependencies required to run the project. After this step you are all set up and ready to run the project 🥳.

> **Note**: Because currently the Microsoft GraphRAG retriever is not working with the codecarbon package, you either have to choose to install the codecarbon package or the Microsoft GraphRAG retriever.

Install the following if you are interested to run the project without the Microsoft GraphRAG retriever:
```bash
pip install .[codecarbon]
```

If you plan to use Microsoft GraphRag (and you are on Python 3.12 or below), run the following command. You can also first run the above command to install with the codecarbon package, run the experiments, delete the codecarbon package and then run the following command to install with Microsoft GraphRAG. This ensures that the emission tracking is working for the experiments that are not using Microsoft GraphRAG.

```bash
pip install .[graphrag]
```

### Creating an Account on Weight & Biases
To run the experiments, the SQA system uses Weight & Biases (W&B) to track the experiments on the dashboard. You can create a free account on [Weight & Biases](https://wandb.auth0.com/login). After you have created the account, once you run any experiment you will be prompted to add the API key to the system. All further instructions will be provided in the terminal.

> **Where do I find the experiments?**

The experiments are located in the `experiments` folder of the SQA system. [Here](./sqa-system/experiments/). There is a `README.md` file located at the top level of the folder that provides an overview of the experiments folder and where to find each of the experiments that we have conducted and analyzed in the master thesis.

> **How can I replicate the experiments?**

We provide a detailed description of how to replicate the experiments in the `README.md` file located in the `experiments` folder. [Here](./sqa-system/experiments/README.md#replicating-the-experiments).

> **Where do I find the artifacts of the KGQA Retrieval Taxonomy?**

We created the KGQA Retrieval Taxonomy by applying the our proposed taxonomy construction process which synthesizes taxonomy information from the literature and incrementally refines the taxonomy. The artifacts that document the construction process are located in the `kgqa_retrieval_taxonomy` folder of the `assets/taxonomy_construction/` folder. [Here](./assets/taxonomy_construction/kgqa_retrieval_taxonomy/). You will also find `README.md` files in those folders that provide an overview of the artifacts and where to find them.

> **Where do I find the Artifacts of the Taxonomy Construction Process?**

We provide template files that can be used to conduct the taxonomy construction process for the creation of a new taxonomy. The artifacts are located in the `template_taxonomy_construction` folder of the `assets/taxonomy_construction/` folder. [Here](./assets/taxonomy_construction/template_taxonomy_construction/). 

> **Where do I find the generation of the KGQA Datasets?**

The generation of the KGQA datasets is located in the `experiments/qa_datasets` folder. [Here](./sqa-system/experiments/qa_datasets/README.md). There is a `README.md` file located at the top level of the folder that provides an overview of the generation process.

> **Where do I find the Question Templates used for the KGQA Dataset Generation?**

The templates are provided in the [templates.md](./sqa-system/experiments/qa_datasets/templates.md) file located in the `experiments/qa_datasets` folder.
