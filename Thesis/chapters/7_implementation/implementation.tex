\chapter{Implementation}
\label{ch:implementation}

In this chapter, we outline the key implementations that we implemented to conduct the evaluation in Chapter~\ref{ch:experimentation}. We begin in Section~\ref{sec:implementation_sqa_framework} by detailing the implementation of the \gls{sqa} framework, which forms the basis for all subsequent implementations and the realization of the experimentation setup. Then, Section~\ref{sec:implementation_hublink} presents the specific implementation details of our proposed HubLink approach (\hyperref[enum:c1]{\textbf{C1}}). Following this, Section~\ref{sec:implementation_orkg} describes the implementation aspects related to the integration of the \gls{orkg} within the \gls{sqa} framework. Last, Section~\ref{sec:implementation_baselines} provides details on the implementation of the various \gls{kgqa} baseline methods used for comparative evaluation against our proposed approach.
