\label{sec:implementation_hublink}

We implemented our proposed HubLink approach by closely following the pseudocode outlined in \autoref{ch:hublink}. For the implementation, we used object-oriented programming, distributing specific responsibilities across different classes. Moreover, to accelerate index building and partial answer generation, we implemented parallel execution using multiple threads.

For the vector store, we chose Chroma\footnote{\url{https://www.trychroma.com/} [last accessed on 25.04.2025]} because it can run locally without a server, making it easy to use and only requiring the installation of a Python package. HubLink is seamlessly integrated into the \gls{sqa} framework and can be run using the configuration system provided. We implemented both proposed HubLink strategies to evaluate their performance on our \gls{kgqa} dataset.
