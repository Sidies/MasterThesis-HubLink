\chapter{Evaluation Preliminaries}
\label{ch:experimentation_preliminaries}

This chapter prepares the evaluation as well as the parameter selection process. In the following, in Section~\ref{sec:exp_prelim_evaluation_concept}, we first go into detail about the evaluation concept which we used to perform the evaluation. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:exp_prelim_environment}, we describe the environment in which the experiments and the parameter selection process have been conducted. Next, Section~\ref{sec:implementation_qa_dataset_generation} documents how the \gls{kgqa} datasets used in this thesis were created. Following this, Section~\ref{sec:exp_prelim_evaluation_framework} explains the evaluation framework, introducing the goals, concepts, and metrics for the evaluation. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:exp_prelim_variables} describes the dependent and independent variables of the experimentation.
