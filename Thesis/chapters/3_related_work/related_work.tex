This chapter outlines related work associated with our contributions. As discussed in the introduction, this thesis centers on the subject of \gls{kgqa} in the context of the scholarly literature task. We propose a novel approach, a taxonomy, and a dataset focusing on this topic. Accordingly, the discussion of related work is organized around these three areas.

In the following sections, we first summarize current work that proposes \gls{kgqa} retrieval approaches, which we see related to our proposed HubLink approach. Then, we focus on the construction of taxonomies as it has been proposed by previous literature and existing taxonomies or classifications for \gls{kgqa}. Last, we investigate datasets for benchmarking on \gls{kgqa} and the construction of such datasets. Although this thesis aligns with these research domains, it introduces distinct advancements that contribute to progress in each respective area.
