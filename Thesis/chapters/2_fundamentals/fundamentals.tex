\chapter{Foundations}
\label{ch:fundamentals}

% We need the fundamentals to understand the background underlying the problem and the solution space.

In this section, we explain the foundational concepts of this master thesis. We begin with the explanation of \gls{kgqa} and \glspl{kg}. Then, we provide an overview of \glspl{llm} and describe how \gls{grag} can unify the abilities of \glspl{llm} with the structured knowledge from \glspl{kg} for answering natural language questions. Following this, we provide an explanation of \gls{ann}, a fundamental concept of our HubLink approach. Next, we describe the metrics that are commonly used in \gls{rag} research, which we will also be using in our evaluation. Lastly, we define the term taxonomy within the scope of the thesis and explain its construction and evaluation concepts.
