\label{ch:taxonomy_construction_approach}

This section presents Contribution \hyperref[enum:c2]{\textbf{C2.1}}, a taxonomy construction methodology that aims to systematically compile knowledge from the literature to create an initial taxonomy, which is then improved and validated. The approach draws inspiration from the revised construction method by \textcite{usman_taxonomies_2017} by adapting the proposed \emph{planning}, \emph{identification and extraction}, \emph{design and construction}, and \emph{validation} phases.

The chapter is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy_evaluation_plan} we first describe an evaluation plan that outlines how a taxonomy can be evaluated according to a \gls{gqm} model. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy_development_process} our proposed taxonomy construction process is presented.
