\chapter{KGQA Retrieval Taxonomy}
\label{ch:question_catalog}

This chapter presents the second primary contribution, \textbf{C2}, of this thesis: a taxonomy for the classification of questions relevant to \gls{kgqa} systems, specifically within the context of literature search tasks. The taxonomy categorizes questions based on characteristics such as operational requirements and structural complexity, which are key dimensions influencing the retrieval performance of \gls{kgqa} systems. Consequently, the taxonomy supports the generation of diverse question datasets, thereby facilitating a thorough assessment of \gls{kgqa} system retrieval capabilities across various question types.

The development of this taxonomy followed the construction process detailed in \autoref{ch:taxonomy_construction_approach}. Accordingly, this chapter is structured to mirror the distinct phases of that methodology. Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy_planning} begins by outlining the \textsc{Planning} phase, defining the objectives and intended applications of the taxonomy. The subsequent \textsc{Literature Survey} phase, documented in Section~\ref{sec:literature_Survey}, describes the identification and selection of relevant literature candidates. Section~\ref{sec:kgqa_extraction_of_classes} then details the \textsc{Extraction} of classes from these candidates, which are subsequently grouped during the \textsc{Clustering} phase presented in Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy_clustering}. Following this, Section~\ref{sec:relevance_of_clusters_analysis} documents the \textsc{Relevance Assessment} of these clusters. Based on this assessment, the initial taxonomy is constructed and refined as described in Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy_design_construction}. The resultant \gls{kgqa} retrieval taxonomy is presented in its final form in Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy_final}. Its practical utility is then demonstrated through an application in a \gls{swa} context in Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy_application}. Concluding the chapter, Section~\ref{sec:taxonomy_threats_to_validity} discusses the potential threats to validity associated with the construction of this specific taxonomy.
